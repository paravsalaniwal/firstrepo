<p>Make sure to fulfill every condition since if you just fulfill 5 of the 6 requirements, you will receive a 0. I should evaluate my code and be as explicit as I can in my written response to ensure this. A majority of the marks are awarded for the ability to describe the intent and functioning of one’s code, thus avoid writing much or too little.</p>
