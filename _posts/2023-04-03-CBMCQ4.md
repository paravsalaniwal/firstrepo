The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of the list and repeatedly eliminates half of the elements until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated. For listOne, the list will be cut in half a maximum of 9 times, with a total of 10 elements needing to be examined. The list will start with 700 elements, then will be reduced to 350 elements, then to 175 elements, then to 87 elements, then to 43 elements, then to 21 elements, then to 10 elements, then to 5 elements, then to 2 elements, and then, finally, to 1 element. For listTwo, the list will also be cut in half a maximum of 9 times, with a total of 10 elements needing to be examined. The list will start with 900 elements, then will be reduced to 450 elements, then to 225 elements, then to 112 elements, then to 56 elements, then to 28 elements, then to 14 elements, then to 7 elements, then to 3 elements, and then, finally, to 1 element.
