To demonstrate mastery of the project and the AP CSP curriculum, this includes demonstrating the program‚Äôs function and purpose, managing complexity, applying algorithms and procedures, testing, and providing thorough descriptions. For our CPT group project, we have been developing a website that resembles an arcade where users may connect and play chess or tic-tac-toe with other players. It will contain a variety of gaming elements, including moves, victories, and user impacts. Additionally, there will be a need that individuals sign in before playing so that their profile can reflect their victories and losses.

It will contain a variety of gaming elements, including moves, victories, and user impacts. Additionally, there will be a need that individuals sign in before playing so that their profile can reflect their victories and losses. I will be concentrating on the website‚Äôs game development as my personal contribution to this project. I‚Äôll make sure to score well on each and every component of the CPT rubric, and I believe I‚Äôm doing well in that regard. I‚Äôve already decided on the program‚Äôs functionality and goal, and I‚Äôll be specific about it in both my write-up and my video. In addition, I‚Äôll be able to test it, and after building the score and time tracker page‚Äôs backend and making sure it works properly, I‚Äôll be able to go into more detail about the algorithms used, how complexity was managed using lists, and how my backend is secure and makes use of a variety of complex programming methodologies. In the video, I‚Äôll demonstrate how your profile will change depending on what object you click.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">5.1and5.2notes</title><link href="https://paravsalaniwal.github.io/firstrepo/2023/01/31/5.1and5.2Notes.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="5.1and5.2notes" /><published>2023-01-31T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-31T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://paravsalaniwal.github.io/firstrepo/2023/01/31/5.1and5.2Notes</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big Idea 5.1 Notes]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CB MCQ</title><link href="https://paravsalaniwal.github.io/firstrepo/2023/01/30/CBMCQ2Corrections.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CB MCQ" /><published>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://paravsalaniwal.github.io/firstrepo/2023/01/30/CBMCQ2Corrections</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total Score:]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CPT Grading 3</title><link href="https://paravsalaniwal.github.io/firstrepo/2023/01/22/CPTScoring3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CPT Grading 3" /><published>2023-01-22T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://paravsalaniwal.github.io/firstrepo/2023/01/22/CPTScoring3</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Submission 1 Grading Student Scoring CB Grading Additional Comments Program Purpose and Function 1 1 The result of the rock paper scissors game is either Win, Lose, or Draw, which makes the program‚Äôs goal extremely obvious and its output simple to comprehend. Data Abstraction 0 0 The list RPS has a variable linked with it, but the list being used to achieve the project‚Äôs goal isn‚Äôt existent, therefore none of the conditions are satisfied here. Managing Complexity 0 0 Although the lists function is described, it is not stated what would occur if the list is not utilized in the application. Procedural Abstraction 0 0 The remaining components of the function rpsGame() match the requirements, however the function‚Äôs overall usage within the program is not specified. Algorithm Implementation 1 1 Here, it is evident that sequencing, iteration, and selection are being employed, and the user‚Äôs input results in a clearly defined output. Testing 1 1 Each call‚Äôs requirements and every call‚Äôs output are specified in detail, along with the expected outcome.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CPT Grading</title><link href="https://paravsalaniwal.github.io/firstrepo/2023/01/15/CPTScoring2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CPT Grading" /><published>2023-01-15T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-15T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://paravsalaniwal.github.io/firstrepo/2023/01/15/CPTScoring2</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Student 1]]></summary></entry></feed>
