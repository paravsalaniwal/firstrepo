## Frontend
Frontend visualization is almost done, final touches needed on CSS
Some refining could be used on the javascript code to implement the automatic user score into the input area


## Backend
Leaderboard system
I have implemented all parts of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Plan to add a system where the score is taken directly from the game and implemented into the user input area to keep true honesty
