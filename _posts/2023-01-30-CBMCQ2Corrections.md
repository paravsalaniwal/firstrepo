# Incorrect Answers

## Question 11

<img width="986" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/215702624-d3db0acb-bfb9-4359-9ab8-46466ca3ab15.png">

Option C was incorrect. If input B is false, the resulting value coming out of the OR gate will be true (since the value of A is true). Since the value of C is true, the resulting value coming out of the AND gate is true. This result contradicts the statement. Therefore, Option A was correct.

## Question 12

<img width="945" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/215703370-f13013d1-2c8d-4aa0-ba6c-5c6f501e119f.png">

I read the options too fast and didn't realize that option A was including both (onFloor1 AND callTo2) AND (onFloor2 AND callTo1) instead of OR. Therefore Option B was correct.

## Question 14

<img width="953" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/215703715-7eb3f287-eba0-4eba-b12c-da3a0d661ed0.png">

Option D is incorrect because if A is inputted then it will lead to an OR situation which than could become a true statement. Therefore Option A is the correct answer because input A directly outputs true.

## Question 15

<img width="977" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/215706649-6150eca2-d16f-4e19-95d5-60383fd76874.png">

Option D is correct because the robot will get stuck on the 5th and 6th block which will create a constant loop where the robot will move back and forth. Therefore this leads to Option A being wrong.

## Question 17

<img width="960" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/215707754-30dbc8ee-beba-4374-8a99-8ac0de821dd1.png">

I only selected one answer when there were 2 correct answers. Option D is also correct because the result <-- is on the outside which helps create the same output as the top one shown.

## Question 27

<img width="937" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/215708081-2282bc94-732e-4010-8f53-d85aac3720f2.png">

The n<--n+1 occurs after the entire repeating code because with Option C, it does it before the repeating which makes it do an extra move every time unnecessarily when it is meant to happen after to lead to the right spot

## Question 28

<img width="971" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/215708493-2b16123a-815b-473f-8108-31465aaf1692.png">

This option is correct. After one iteration of the 'Repeat 2 times' loop, the robot will end up in the upper-right square facing to the left. After the second iteration of the Repeat 2 times loop, the robot will end up in the upper-left square facing down. The robot has finished in the gray square.

## Question 30

<img width="1007" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/215708644-426b6c07-160a-4aa6-ae52-bcf0d660a370.png">

Option B is correct instead of Option A because the draw circle command should come after the variables values have been calculated because then it will know with what dimensions to draw the circle.

## Question 41

<img width="942" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/215708997-6031bc17-f8c7-44bd-aead-e9553556ea83.png">

This option is incorrect. The statement 'Random (1 , 10)' could evaluate to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. There is a one out of 10, or 10 percent, chance that it could evaluate to 2. If this happens, the value of 'sum' is increased by 1, which simulates a person voting for the candidate. This does not match the goal of the program, which is to simulate an election in which a certain candidate is expected to receive 20 percent of the vote.

## Question 43

<img width="936" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/215709204-b7b1fc74-fd28-4d0a-8533-1317dd9af7ec.png">

Computer simulations don't necessarily have to be once the real-world object has been created. Computer simulations usually make some simplifying assumptions about the real-world object or system being modeled.

## Question 45

<img width="952" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/215709984-e688fb27-d5b7-4a15-89d7-454df588489a.png">

This answer is wrong because it doesn’t make sense that a heuristic solution would be useful when the problem can be solved in a reasonable time, since you’re better off trying to actually solve the problem then. 

## Question 47

<img width="935" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/215710277-9c1bdbed-1c56-49eb-83c3-bc903153a38c.png">

This option is incorrect. A heuristic is a technique that can find an approximate solution more quickly when exact methods are too slow. Calculating a grade can be done exactly and quickly by a program. Option C is correct because finding the shortest driving route is an optimization problem that cannot be solved in a reasonable time, and a heuristic is a technique that can find an approximate solution more quickly when exact methods are too slow.
