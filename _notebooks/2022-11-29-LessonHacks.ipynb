    "- A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values).\n",
    "- Variables can be seen as \"containers\" and each container has a name that holds what it is supposed to hold.\n",
    "- Variables have different data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hacks 1\n",
    "Questions (College Board's Essential Knowledge):\n",
    "1. What exactly IS a variable?\n",
    "   - A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time.\n",
    "2. What is the best data type to represent someone's dog's name?\n",
    "   - A string\n",
    "3. Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values?\n",
    "   - So that they have an appropriate name to the value which will be contained.\n",
    "4. What is the best way to represent someone's phone number?\n",
    "   - The best way is to use a string to make sure the numbers don't interfere with the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus (Not required but important to know): \n",
    "1. How can we update a variable's value\n",
    "   - Using + or - for incrementing or decrementing\n",
    "2. What function is used to receive a user's input?\n",
    "   - input()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hacks 2\n",
    "Answer these:\n",
    "1. In your **own** words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is\n",
    "   - The assignment operator is the equal sign (=) which allows to assign elements of code to a value.\n",
    "2. In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables?\n",
    "   - <--\n",
    "3. A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22?\n",
    "   - The command would display 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hacks 3\n",
    "1. What is a list?\n",
    "   - A sequence of elements with each element being a variable.\n",
    "2. What is an element\n",
    "   - The items inside of a list.\n",
    "3. What is an easy way to reference the elements in a list or string?\n",
    "   - using print()\n",
    "4. What is an example of a string?\n",
    "   - Phone number\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a list with indices \n",
    "* Index a part of the list that you created.\n",
    "* Try to index from the end "
