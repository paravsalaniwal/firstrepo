<p>The results and grades matched with mine. As there are more projects, I am better able to fully understand the standards set by Collegeboard and am better able to determine whether or not something earns points. Overall, this CPT project has some strong components, but the list and code are where they really fell short because of how lacking they were and how they neglected to include key crucial components.</p>

<p>Between the grade I gave the project and the grade College Board assigned it, there was only one difference. I believed the list wasn’t being stored properly because it originated in the data abstraction section. Collegeboard thought it was being saved properly.</p>

<p>The only difference between my results and those of Collegeboard is the testing. Although Collegeboard thinks the Testing doesn’t meet the requirements to earn points, I granted the Testing section the points because it contained all the calls required to do so.</p>

<p>My score matches the college board’s score identically. Due to its simplicity, this contribution was simple to understand how it operated and simple to score. Because I can now accurately score the full project, which I have definitely improved upon, my overall rating is improving.</p>

<h1 id="overall-reflection">
<a class="anchor" href="#overall-reflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overall Reflection</h1>
<p>I think my score is on par with those obtained by these instances on the CollegeBoard. I have a basic understanding of the specifications and what my project needs to succeed. To satisfy everyone’s needs, my project must be broad and have a variety of features and abstractions. One of the most obvious reasons a contribution would not have passed the standards in one area was a lack of a thorough explanation of how something functions. I’ll keep that in mind and make sure to include as much information as I can to show how my project meets the criteria.</p>
