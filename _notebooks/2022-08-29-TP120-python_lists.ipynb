    "#### List and Dictionary purpose\n",
    "Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "List is used to collect many instances of a pattern\n",
    "Dictionary is used to define data patterns.\n",
    "Iteration is often used to process through lists.\n",
    "To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned above, a List is a data type: class 'list'\n",
    "A 'list' data type has the method '.append(expression)' that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances.\n",
    "In the example below, the expression is appended to the 'list' is the data type: class 'dict'\n",
    "At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so."
