| **Submission 1 Grading** | Student Scoring | CB Grading | Additional Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | At first, I thought the student earned the point because they were able to articulate the function, the purpose, and the input and output. Following an examination of the college board scores, I found that the student had not complied with the requirements for explanation since their explanations of the function and purpose appeared to be inconsistent, and their input and output were incorrect.|
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The information in animalList is not explained in the response. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The student illustrates how the complexity and lack of a list will change the code. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The user includes a parameter, but they are unable to describe how the operation works in general. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The user offers a brief overview but doesn't clarify how the algorithm can be duplicated. Sequencing, selection, and iteration are among the information offered. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Inputs of various types are provided, and the submission describes the results that follow, explaining any differences. |
