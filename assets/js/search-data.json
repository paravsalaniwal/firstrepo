Hacks 2 D5 . Link to flowchart can be found linked here . Lessons 12 and 13 . Notes: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements | Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on | Steps of developing procedure: picking name, thinking of parameters, making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. | A type of procedural abstraction is one which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. | Procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure | .

            "content": "Night at the Museum . During the night of the museum event, I was able to see the projects of my classmates and students from other periods, even though my time at the museum event that night was only for 30 minutes. Due to the fact that our project was not entirely finished, my group received a lot of comments and tips from other students. We drew more influence from other projects to alter the project’s looks and add new features, like a comment section where users could discuss the various teams we offered. One parent in particular asked us questions regarding the site’s mechanics and general programming, which we were able to satisfactorily respond to. They also suggested that we change the site’s colors to match the theme of basketball more. I really enjoyed getting to know people from different classes and interacting with those who weren’t involved in CSP and are thinking about joining. . CollegeBoard APCSP Multiple Choice Final . As we had to take the APCSP CollegeBoard final, I felt confident knowing I have truly learned a lot from this class and taking advantage of my resources. I have been working with my team and using external resources such as the CollegeBoard videos. Creating multiple pages from fastpages templates throughout the year helped me understand how to code with ease for both the front end and back end. I had completed the CollegeBoard MC Final and received a 45/50. . The 5 questions I got incorrect are below: . . A1. The correct answer to this question above was option A: I and II only. This is correct because the usernames of the people on Brandon and Cynthia’s contact lists are irrelevant to which restaurant to eat yet, although knowing the geographical location is relevant because it is looking to find restaurants near by. . . A2. The correct answer to this is option D: Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices. This is because protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way. . . A3. The correct answer to this is option C. This is because protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way. This is because if the number of units of electricity used is 25 or less, the cost is 5 times the number of units. Otherwise, the cost is 5 times the first 25 units plus 7 times the number of units above 25. . . A4. The correct answer to this is option A and D. This is because for option A, the code segment sets maxPS to 50 by default, then uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time &gt; 120. . . A5. The correct answer to this is option C. This is because the first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of y (which is 50) to x. The fifth statement assigns the value of z (which is 75) to y. The sixth statement assigns the value of x (which is 50) to z. Therefore, x and z both have the value 50. .",

Are there any PBL (project based learning) scenarios in College computer science classes? . Yes, one of the best scenario is studying in groups because especially in comp sci, you will face lots of errors that you won’t understand how to solve yourself, but others may be able to help you with their knowledge . | . How have you applied CS in your major if you are not majoring in CS? . For statistics, you have to program using MatLabs and other sources . | .

            "content": "List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern Dictionary is used to define data patterns. Iteration is often used to process through lists. To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Position:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Position&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;NFL Draft Pick:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;NFL Draft Pick&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;NFL Top 100 Rank:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;NFL Top 100 Rank&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Total Yards:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Total Yards&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Total TDs:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Total TDs&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Teams: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Teams&quot;])) print() def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output Deebo Samuel Position: Wide Reciever NFL Draft Pick: Second Round Pick 36 NFL Top 100 Rank: 19 Total Yards: 1770 Total TDs: 14 Teams: San Francisco 49ers Matthew Stafford Position: Quarterback NFL Draft Pick: First Round Pick 1 NFL Top 100 Rank: 27 Total Yards: 4886 Total TDs: 41 Teams: Detroit Lions, Los Angeles Rams .",

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env .
