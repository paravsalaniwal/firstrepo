Logical thinking background helped with coding and solving problems . | Reflected on what he wanted to do as he entered the CompSci major . | . What is the biggest challenge you’ve encountered with CompSci? . Keeping motivated is an obstacle you have to move past because of all the errors in code that may make you frustrated . | There’s lots of people that are going to be better than you, but don’t be stressed out about trying to reach them and be the best you can be to satisfy yourself . | The temptation of copy codes from online and your peers because it can just be seen as a checklist of assignments that you need to complete, although it is about how well you understand it and try to push your way to do more than just a checklist . | It can be really demotivating when you have to start a brand new code as it can take lots of time and struggles to complete . | . Are there any PBL (project based learning) scenarios in College computer science classes? . Yes, one of the best scenario is studying in groups because especially in comp sci, you will face lots of errors that you won’t understand how to solve yourself, but others may be able to help you with their knowledge . | . How have you applied CS in your major if you are not majoring in CS? . For statistics, you have to program using MatLabs and other sources . | . For existing college students have you had a job with a school or professor? . Tutoring positions (work with professors) . | Code Ninja (teaching younger kids) . | Northrop Grumman (robotics projects) . | UCSD Professor (machine learning) . | . Summary: These college students helped me understand how computer science is such an important skill to learn for not just a computer science major, but also engineering, math major, science major, and lots more. With how the world has evolved to use technology, computer science has just become more used and prominent in the world. I learned that you will face lots of challenges through computer science but you must push yourself and work through it with the help of your peers. .",

            "title": "Lists, Dictionaries, Iteration",
            "content": "List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern Dictionary is used to define data patterns. Iteration is often used to process through lists. To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. . InfoDb = [] #Append to player profile of Deebo Samuel in the 2021 NFL Season InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Deebo&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;Position&quot;: &quot;Wide Reciever&quot;, &quot;NFL Draft Pick&quot;: &quot;Second Round Pick 36&quot;, &quot;NFL Top 100 Rank&quot;: &quot;19&quot;, &quot;Total Yards&quot;: &quot;1770&quot;, &quot;Total TDs&quot;: &quot;14&quot;, &quot;Teams&quot;: [&quot;San Francisco 49ers&quot;] }) #Append to player profile of Matthew Stafford in the 2021 NFL Season InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Matthew&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Stafford&quot;, &quot;Position&quot;: &quot;Quarterback&quot;, &quot;NFL Draft Pick&quot;: &quot;First Round Pick 1&quot;, &quot;NFL Top 100 Rank&quot;: &quot;27&quot;, &quot;Total Yards&quot;: &quot;4886&quot;, &quot;Total TDs&quot;: &quot;41&quot;, &quot;Teams&quot;: [&quot;Detroit Lions&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Rams&quot;] }) # Prints the data structure print(InfoDb) . [{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Deebo&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Samuel&#39;, &#39;Position&#39;: &#39;Wide Reciever&#39;, &#39;NFL Draft Pick&#39;: &#39;Second Round Pick 36&#39;, &#39;NFL Top 100 Rank&#39;: &#39;19&#39;, &#39;Total Yards&#39;: &#39;1770&#39;, &#39;Total TDs&#39;: &#39;14&#39;, &#39;Teams&#39;: [&#39;San Francisco 49ers&#39;]}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Matthew&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Stafford&#39;, &#39;Position&#39;: &#39;Quarterback&#39;, &#39;NFL Draft Pick&#39;: &#39;First Round Pick 1&#39;, &#39;NFL Top 100 Rank&#39;: &#39;27&#39;, &#39;Total Yards&#39;: &#39;4886&#39;, &#39;Total TDs&#39;: &#39;41&#39;, &#39;Teams&#39;: [&#39;Detroit Lions&#39;, &#39;Los Angeles Rams&#39;]}] . Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Position:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Position&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;NFL Draft Pick:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;NFL Draft Pick&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;NFL Top 100 Rank:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;NFL Top 100 Rank&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Total Yards:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Total Yards&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Total TDs:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Total TDs&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Teams: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Teams&quot;])) print() def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Deebo Samuel Position: Wide Reciever NFL Draft Pick: Second Round Pick 36 NFL Top 100 Rank: 19 Total Yards: 1770 Total TDs: 14 Teams: San Francisco 49ers Matthew Stafford Position: Quarterback NFL Draft Pick: First Round Pick 1 NFL Top 100 Rank: 27 Total Yards: 4886 Total TDs: 41 Teams: Detroit Lions, Los Angeles Rams . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output Deebo Samuel Position: Wide Reciever NFL Draft Pick: Second Round Pick 36 NFL Top 100 Rank: 19 Total Yards: 1770 Total TDs: 14 Teams: San Francisco 49ers Matthew Stafford Position: Quarterback NFL Draft Pick: First Round Pick 1 NFL Top 100 Rank: 27 Total Yards: 4886 Total TDs: 41 Teams: Detroit Lions, Los Angeles Rams . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output Deebo Samuel Position: Wide Reciever NFL Draft Pick: Second Round Pick 36 NFL Top 100 Rank: 19 Total Yards: 1770 Total TDs: 14 Teams: San Francisco 49ers Matthew Stafford Position: Quarterback NFL Draft Pick: First Round Pick 1 NFL Top 100 Rank: 27 Total Yards: 4886 Total TDs: 41 Teams: Detroit Lions, Los Angeles Rams .",

Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git.

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
