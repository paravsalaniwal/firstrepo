Data Abstraction 0 0 The list RPS has a variable linked with it, but the list being used to achieve the project‚Äôs goal isn‚Äôt existent, therefore none of the conditions are satisfied here. Managing Complexity 0 0 Although the lists function is described, it is not stated what would occur if the list is not utilized in the application. Procedural Abstraction 0 0 The remaining components of the function rpsGame() match the requirements, however the function‚Äôs overall usage within the program is not specified. Algorithm Implementation 1 1 Here, it is evident that sequencing, iteration, and selection are being employed, and the user‚Äôs input results in a clearly defined output.

The objective of this blog is to introduce OOP with the intention of PBL task to create a database. The foundations for a database is defining a Class and understanding instance data and methods.

Following an examination of the college board scores, I found that the student had not complied with the requirements for explanation since their explanations of the function and purpose appeared to be inconsistent, and their input and output were incorrect. Data Abstraction 0 0 The information in animalList is not explained in the response. Managing Complexity 0 0 The student¬†illustrates¬†how the complexity and lack of a list will change the code. Procedural Abstraction 0 0 The user¬†includes¬†a parameter, but they are unable to describe how the operation works in general. Algorithm Implementation 0 0 The user offers a brief overview but doesn‚Äôt clarify how the algorithm can be duplicated. Sequencing, selection, and iteration are among the information offered. Testing 1 1 Inputs of various types are provided, and the submission describes the results that follow, explaining any differences.]]></summary></entry></feed>
