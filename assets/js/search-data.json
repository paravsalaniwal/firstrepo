            "content": "Setting up Machines with Conda Scripts . GitHub . What is GitHub? | Why do we use GitHub? Why not Google Drive or messages? | What&#39;s the difference between Git and GitHub? | Name as many Git commands as you can: | . Two Main Machines . Which is better, MacOS or Windows? | Give some differences between MacOS and Windows in terms of the development we use in APCSP: | If you are on Windows, you want to skip the MacOS Setup instructions. | . Our Tools: . What is the first tool you remember installing? | Why was installations so hard the first time? | Without looking back at previous notes, name three tools you remember installing. This can be kernels, extensions, any installation for APCSP, and also write why it is needed. | . Actual Installations: . Tool setup is a week 0 thing. You should already have the knowledge to set up your machine. There is also a high chance you had to remove your environments and set up your machine again due to errors. If, for some reason, these don&#39;t apply to you, go here to set up your machine, here to check everything working with Bash, and here for Docker setup, which are the main tools on our machine needed to develop in APCSP. . MacOS Conda Scripts . After installing Homebrew, VSCode, and Python2, you&#39;ll need to run these Homebrew commands: . brew list # list packages brew update # update package list brew upgrade # upgrade packages brew install git # install latest git brew install python # install python3 for development python --version # version of python3 installed brew install java # openjdk install . Windows Conda Scripts . To get set up, run these commands: . wsl --install wsl --list wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04 # restart machine wsl cd ~ mkdir vscode ls cd ~/vscode # changes the directory to path for vscode files git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP.git # clone repo cd APCSP # changes the directory to path for APCSP repos assets code . # opens APCSP in VSCode cd .. # changes the directory to the previous/parent directory git config --global user.email mygmail@gmail.com # tell git your email git config --global user.name mygithub # tell git your github id shay@MSI:/mnt/c/Users/ShayM$ git config --global user.email your@email.here shay@MSI:/mnt/c/Users/ShayM$ git config --global user.name yourusernamehere # restart machine PS C: Users UserName&gt; wsl # Windows prompt to WSL command cd /tmp wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh chmod +x Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh # Answer yes to all the prompts ./Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh # run apt package commands now sudo apt list # list packages sudo apt update # update package list sudo apt upgrade # upgrade packages sudo apt install python2 # install python2 for package dependencies sudo apt install python3 python3-pip # install python3 and pip3 for development python --version # version of python3 should be shown sudo apt install default-jdk default-jre # java install java --version # java runtime version javac --version # java compiler version sudo apt install unzip # unzip utility . Setting Up Kernels . Now that you have everything installed on MacOS/Windows, we need to get kernels installed so that we can develop inside Fastpages notebooks. To do that, run these commands on both MacOS and Windows: . (base) id:~$ conda --version (base) id:~$ conda install jupyter # install jupyter (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list installed kernels Available kernels: python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 (base) id:~$ # start in home directory (base) id:~$ pip install bash_kernel # download bash kernel Collecting bash_kernel Downloading bash_kernel-0.7.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl (15 kB) Requirement already satisfied: pexpect&gt;=4.0 in ./anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from bash_kernel) (4.8.0) Requirement already satisfied: ptyprocess&gt;=0.5 in ./anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from pexpect&gt;=4.0-&gt;bash_kernel) (0.7.0) Installing collected packages: bash-kernel Successfully installed bash-kernel-0.7.2 (base) id:~$ python -m bash_kernel.install # install kernel Installing IPython kernel spec (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list kernels Available kernels: bash /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/bash python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 (base) id:~$ conda install nodejs # node is framework for JavaScript kernel (base) id:~$ npm -version # node package manager comes with nodejs (base) id:~$ npm install -g ijavascript # get the kernel (base) id:~$ ijsinstall # install javascript kernel (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list kernels Available kernels: bash /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/bash javascript /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/javascript python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 . By now, you should already know how to clone Git repositories into your VSCode directory. Once you do that, you&#39;re all set for developing with GitHub Pages and Fastpages! . Before We Set Up Pages, A Guide to Git . As we&#39;ve discussed, Git is different from GitHub. Because GitHub is merely the place where we store Git repos, we use Git&#39;s commands to help us get, open, and configure these repositories. Here are some of the Git commands you should be using a lot (In the comments, tell what each Git command does): . git clone {repos-name-here.git} # what does it do? git checkout [branch] # what does it do? git fork {repos-name-here.git} # what does it do? git commit -m {&quot;commit-msg&quot;} # what does it do? git pull # what does it do? git push # what does it do? # After this line, name other commands that you can use and what they do. This should be easy, as you&#39;ve already answered the qeue . Setting Up GitHub Pages . Some of you may have come to know that GitHub Pages is starting to become outdated. So why do we still use it? The answer is that we are in a class, and following a curriculum with something like GitHub Pages is much easier than creating portfolio content from scratch, which becomes quite unecessary. Therefore, we can use GitHub Pages to create this content instead. On the topic of unecessary vs necessary coding, we don&#39;t need to make GitHub Pages from scratch as opposed to using a template that our very own Mr. Mortensen created for us. To do that, we can go to the Leuck Reunion repository and use the template to make our own GitHub Pages. Then, in Ubuntu, we can git clone our repository and open it in VSCode. After we have it open, the last thing we want to do is set up local hosting for this website, so that we can preview it and make changes in real time. To do that, head here to install Jekyll for Ubuntu, here to install Ruby next, and here to finalize the process by installing Bundler. . Setting Up FastPages . In Setting Up Github Pages, we talked about how it is easier to use a template to create portfolio content. It is also easier to use a template when creating the portfolio itself. To do that, we can use Fastpages, which is what we have been using to show our blogs, code, and projects. However, Fastpages has been deprecated for some time now, so the instructions in Week 0 won&#39;t be effective. So, we need to fork the APCSP Fastpages. To do that, follow this video to get started developing with Fastpages. . Hacks . Show how you incorporate three tools that we have installed into your project. 0.1 points for each feature. (0.3). This can include code, but definitely blog about it. | frontend hack goes here | backend hack goes here | .",

            "content": "Introduction . Frontend and backend are two essential components of a web application. The frontend is the part of the application that interacts with the user, whereas the backend is the part that handles the logic and data processing behind the scenes. . The frontend, also known as the client-side, typically consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that runs in the user&#39;s web browser. The frontend handles the user interface, page layout, and overall look of the application. It also handles user interactions, such as submitting forms, clicking buttons, and navigating between pages. . On the other hand, the backend, also known as the server-side, typically consists of a server, a database, and, in our case, APIs. The backend handles the processing and storage of data, manages user authentication and authorization, and handles business logic and rules. The backend also communicates with the frontend, providing the necessary data to render the user interface and processing user inputs. . Backend . In our class we mainly use Python and SQL/JSON to create APIs and databases. Here is a simple example of creating a SQL database and using CRUD as well. . What is CRUD . C: The &#39;C&#39; stands for create, meaning to create a new entry in a database. In this case, creating a new entry about a certain movie or TV show. . | R: Read, or to retrieve data from the database. In this case it is selecting the movie/TV shwo that you choose to display. . | U: Update, or changing an existing entry in the database. In this case it is selecting the preexisting movie/TV show and changing the values to match what you want. . | D: Delete, or removing data from the database. In this case it is selecting the preexisting movie/TV show and removing the entry from the database. . | . Films API . This API is intended to be used as a list of movies and TV shows that a person has watched. It includes attributes for the Film name(key), the year released, the language, the number of episodes, A list of the number of episodes(using pickletype), and a youtube url for the trailer. The CRUD works as follows: Create: Enter the above mentioned attributes Read: Returns all of the films and their attributes Update: Takes in new episodes watched, and a list of their names, and adds them to their respective attibutes Delete: Option for deleting every film, also takes in a name to delete that film if it exists . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;films.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE movies (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, year INTEGER, epcount INTEGER, language TEXT, trailer TEXT, eplist TEXT)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database and close the connection conn.commit() conn.close() . import sqlite3 def create(): # Ask the user for movie details title = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show title: &quot;) year = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show release year: &quot;) epcount = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show epcount: &quot;) language = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show language: &quot;) eplist = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show episode names: &quot;) trailer = input(&quot;Enter the link movie/tv show trailer: &quot;) # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands database = &#39;films.db&#39; connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record into db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO movies (title, year, epcount, language, eplist, trailer) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (title, year, epcount, language, eplist, trailer)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;{title} has been added to the list of movies.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record:&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() .

Movie deleted successfully. . Fetching . Overview . Involves retrieving data from a server or database | Can use different HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, to perform different types of operations on the server. | Fetching can be done through a variety of ways including AJAX, XHR, and Axios | In APCSP we tend to use the Fetch API over anything else | Fetching involves sending a request to a server using a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which identifies the location of the resource being requested. | Can receive data in various formats, including JSON | JSON data can be parsed into objects and arrays in JavaScript, making it easy to work with and manipulate in the frontend | . Python Fetch Using Request . import requests url = &quot;https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/titles&quot; headers = { &quot;content-type&quot;: &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;,

            "content": "NOTE . As you follow along, make sure to fill in the blanks and complete the coding exercises! . Introduction . When building an application that requires users to create accounts or sign in, handling data related to users is crucial. This data can include things like user profiles, preferences, and activity logs, which can be used to personalize the user experience and improve the application&#39;s performance. . For example, by storing a user&#39;s name and profile picture, the application can address the user by name and display their picture, creating a more personal experience. Activity logs can also be used to track user behavior and help the application recommend new features or improvements. . By learning how to handle data related to users effectively and responsibly, you&#39;ll be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to build robust and user-friendly applications that meet the needs of your users. . For simplicity purposes, we will be lecturing on how one can store and manipulate user data for future utilization. . Here we go! . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . In Python, classes are templates used to create objects, which are instances of those classes. Classes define the data elements (attributes) and methods that describe the behavior of the objects. Let&#39;s explore how to define a class and create objects in Python. . Example: Defining a User class . class User: def __init__(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . In this example, we define a User class with a constructor method init that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . In the context of backend functionality, this class can be used to create, manipulate, and manage user data. For example, when a new user signs up for an account, you could create a new User object with their username and email. This object can then be used to perform various operations, such as validating the user&#39;s input, storing the user&#39;s data in a database, or processing user-related requests. . Creating a new user: . new_user = User(&quot;john_doe&quot;, &quot;john@example.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Username: john_doe, Email: john@example.com . Lecture Topics: . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . In Python, classes are templates used to create objects, which are instances of those classes. Classes define the data elements (attributes) and methods that describe the behavior of the objects. Let&#39;s explore how to define a class and create objects in Python. . Example: Defining a User class . class User: def init(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email . def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . In this example, we define a User class with a constructor method init that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . Creating a new user: . python . new_user = User(&quot;john_doe&quot;, &quot;john@example.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Here, we create a new User object, new_user, with a specified username and email. We then call the display_info method to display the user&#39;s information. . Using property decorators (getter and setter) . Property decorators allow developers to access and modify instance data more concisely. The @property decorator creates a getter method, while the @attribute.setter decorator creates a setter method. . Example: . class Employee: def __init__(self, employee_id, name): self._employee_id = employee_id self._name = name @property def name(self): return self._name @name.setter def name(self, new_name): self._name = new_name . In this example, the Employee class has a name attribute, which is accessed and modified through the name property getter and setter methods. The _name attribute uses an underscore prefix, which is a convention to indicate it should not be accessed directly. . In the context of backend functionality, this Employee class can be used to model employees within an application. You can create instances of this class to store and manage employee data, and the getter and setter methods can be used to access and modify employee information in a controlled way. . Usage: . employee = Employee(1001, &quot;John Doe&quot;) print(employee.name) # Get the name using the getter method employee.name = &quot;Jane Doe&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(employee.name) . John Doe Jane Doe . employee = Employee(1001, &quot;John Doe&quot;) print(employee.name) # Get the name using the getter method . employee.name = &quot;Jane Doe&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(employee.name) . In the context of backend functionality, the getter and setter methods provide a clean and controlled way to access and modify the attributes of an object. This can be particularly useful when interacting with databases, APIs, or other parts of a web application that require the management and manipulation of object attributes. . CHECK: Explain the function of getters and setters in your own words. . class Car: def __init__(self, make, model, year): self._make = make self._model = model self._year = year @property def make(self): return self._make @make.setter def make(self, new_make): self._make = new_make @property def model(self): return self._model @model.setter def model(self, new_model): self._model = new_model @property def year(self): return self._year @year.setter def year(self, new_year): self._year = new_year . Take notes here on property decorators and the purpose they serve: . Students can then practice creating instances of their Car class and using the getter and setter methods to access and modify the car attributes. . In the context of backend functionality, this Car class can be used to model cars within an application. You can create instances of this class to store and manage car data, and the getter and setter methods can be used to access and modify car information in a controlled way. . Overview . WE COVERED: In conclusion, we have covered essential concepts in object-oriented programming using Python, including: . Defining classes and creating objects Property decorators (getter and setter) Class methods and static methods Inheritance and method overriding Working with multiple objects and class attributes . These concepts provide a solid foundation for understanding how to model real-world entities using classes and objects in Python. By learning to work with classes, objects, and their methods, students can develop more efficient and modular code. . As students become more comfortable with these concepts, they can explore more advanced topics, such as multiple inheritance, abstract classes, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Additionally, they can apply these principles to practical projects like web development with Flask and SQLite, as discussed earlier. . Overall, mastering object-oriented programming will greatly enhance students&#39; ability to develop complex and maintainable software systems. . Databases and SQlite . SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. Unlike other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite is embedded within an application, which means it does not require a separate server process to operate. This makes SQLite a great choice for small-scale applications or for use in situations where you don&#39;t want to set up a full database server. . In this lesson, we will be demonstrating how to set up a SQLite database in Flask, which provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with SQLite databases, and we&#39;ll walk through the process of setting up a new database, creating tables, and adding data. We&#39;ll also cover some basic SQL commands that you can use to interact with your database, including CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. By the end of this lesson, you&#39;ll have a good understanding of how to work with SQLite databases in Flask and be ready to start building your own applications. . Setting up a SQLite database in Flask . One of the key features of Flask is its ability to work seamlessly with databases, including SQLite. A database is a collection of data stored in an organized manner that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. . SQlite databse in Flask . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;example.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE example_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() .

Basic SQL commands (create, read, update, delete) . SQL is really useful because it helps people do a bunch of things with the data stored in databases. For example, they can use it to create new tables to organize data, add new data to a table, update data that&#39;s already there, or delete data that&#39;s no longer needed. . CRUD is an acronym that stands for the fundamental operations that can be performed on a database, which are Create, Read, Update, and Delete. A widely-used lightweight database management system is SQLite, which can be easily integrated with different programming languages. . C: To create a new record in a database, you must first define the table structure that will store the data. This can be accomplished using SQL commands such as CREATE. Once the table is created, data can be added to it using the INSERT INTO command. . | R: To retrieve data from the database, you can use the READ command. You can specify which fields you want to retrieve and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. There are also several functions available to aggregate and manipulate data. . | U: To modify existing data in the database, you can use the UPDATE command. You will need to specify which table and fields you want to update, and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. . | D: To remove data from the database, you can use the DELETE command . | . Take notes here on the basic components of SQL: . import sqlite3 def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu . This block of code is a menu function that helps with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tasks and displays the schema. The menu function acts as a control point that directs the program to call different functions based on what the user wants to do. When users enter their preferred action, the input is checked to see which function to use. The menu function is created with no arguments and is called repeatedly, displaying the menu options until the user decides to leave. . Creating a Database . import sqlite3 def create_database(): # Connect to the database (will create it if it doesn&#39;t exist) connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Create the professors table if it doesn&#39;t already exist cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS professors ( name TEXT, field TEXT, rating REAL, reviews TEXT )&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit changes and close the connection connection.commit() connection.close() # Call the function to create the database create_database() . Create Function: . import sqlite3 def create(): database = &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; name = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s name: &quot;) field = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s field of expertise: &quot;) rating = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s rating (out of 10): &quot;) reviews = input(&quot;Enter any reviews or comments about the professor: &quot;) # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record into db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO professors (name, field, rating, reviews) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, field, rating, reviews)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name} has been added to the list of coding professors.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() . Mort has been added to the list of coding professors. . The create() function allows users to input information about a coding professor and store it in a SQLite database named &#39;professors.db&#39;. This script prompts the user for the professor&#39;s name, field of expertise, rating out of 10, and any reviews or comments about the professor. It then establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands. . Read Function . import sqlite3 def read(): try: # Open a connection to the database and create a cursor connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Fetch all records from the professors table cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors&quot;) rows = cursor.fetchall() # If there are any records, print them if len(rows) &gt; 0: print(&quot;List of coding professors:&quot;) for row in rows: print(f&quot;Name: {row[0]} nField of expertise: {row[1]} nRating: {row[2]} nReviews: {row[3]} n&quot;) else: print(&quot;There are no coding professors in the list.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while connecting to the database:&quot;, error) finally: # Close the cursor and the connection to the database cursor.close() connection.close() read() . List of coding professors: Name: Mort Field of expertise: CSP/A Rating: 1.0 Reviews: W . This code demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database using Python and the sqlite3 library. The first step is to establish a connection to the database and create a cursor object to execute SQL commands. Then, a SELECT query is executed to fetch all records from the &quot;professors&quot; table. If there are any records, the code iterates through each record and prints out the name, field of expertise, rating, and reviews for each coding professor. If there are no records in the table, a message indicating so is printed. . Update Function . import sqlite3 def update(): database = &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Get the professor&#39;s name to update name = input(&quot;Enter the name of the professor to update: &quot;) # Retrieve the current record from the database cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) record = cursor.fetchone() # If the professor is found, update the record if record: print(&quot;Enter the new information for the professor:&quot;) field = input(f&quot;Current field: {record[1]} nNew field: &quot;) rating = input(f&quot;Current rating: {record[2]} nNew rating: &quot;) reviews = input(f&quot;Current reviews: {record[3]} nNew reviews: &quot;) # Execute SQL to update the record cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE professors SET field=?, rating=?, reviews=? WHERE name=?&quot;, (field, rating, reviews, name)) connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name}&#39;s record has been updated.&quot;) # If the professor is not found, notify the user else: print(f&quot;No record found for {name}.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while updating record&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() update () . Enter the new information for the professor: Mort&#39;s record has been updated. . This is an implementation of an update function for the professors database using the sqlite3 module in Python. The function first establishes a connection to the database file &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; and creates a cursor object to execute SQL commands. It prompts the user to enter the name of the professor to update and retrieves the corresponding record from the database using a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to match the professor&#39;s name. If the professor is found in the database, the user is prompted to enter new information for the professor&#39;s field of expertise, rating, and reviews. The function then executes an update statement with the new information to update the record in the database. . Delete Function . import sqlite3 def delete(): # Connect to the database and create a cursor connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Prompt the user for the name of the professor to delete name = input(&quot;Enter the name of the professor you want to delete: &quot;) # Use a SQL query to find the professor with the given name cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) row = cursor.fetchone() # If the professor exists, confirm deletion and delete the record if row: confirm = input(f&quot;Are you sure you want to delete {name}? (y/n): &quot;) if confirm.lower() == &#39;y&#39;: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name} has been deleted from the list of coding professors.&quot;) else: print(f&quot;{name} not found in the list of coding professors.&quot;) # Close the cursor and the connection to the database cursor.close() connection.close() delete() . Mort has been deleted from the list of coding professors. . This code is a Python function for deleting a record from a SQLite database. The function prompts the user to input the name of the professor they want to delete. It then uses a SQL query to search for the professor in the database. If the professor is found, the user is prompted to confirm the deletion. If the user confirms, the function executes a SQL command to delete the record from the database. The function also prints a message confirming that the professor has been deleted from the list of coding professors.

            "content": "Review Topics . All of the topics below are things that have been heavily covered and used throughout the class. We will mostly be focusing on more complicated uses and mechanics of these topics. . Lists . What are Lists? Lists are an ordered sequence of elements, where each element is a variable | Unlike dictionaries, lists&#39; keys are all integers that describe the order of the list | Elements can be easily added and removed - &#39;append()&#39;, &#39;insert()&#39;, &#39;remove()&#39;, and &#39;pop()&#39; | Has elements in a list can be accessed using index numbers | Contains built in functions such as &#39;len()&#39;, &#39;min()&#39;, &#39;max()&#39;, and &#39;sum()&#39; | . | . Some examples of lists: . Playlist of songs | names of students in a class | contacts on your phone | Shopping list | Sports roster . | Each element of a string is referenced by an index (which is a number) and they generally start 0 but for the AP Exam it starts at 1. . AP Exam: 1,2,3,4 etc. | Python: 0,1,2,3 etc. | . | . How do lists Manage Complexity of a program? . We may not need as many variables. For example: One Variable that holds all students would be better than having a variable for EACH student | There can also be a list of test scores so if they need to be curved then the same calculation can be applied to the list (that has all the students) instead of doing the calculations one at a time | . | . Answer the following questions about the code block below: . Why do you think lists are helpful? What word does College Board like to use to describe the function of lists? Lists are useful because they make coding simpler to comprehend and use, which reduces complexity. We can use built-in functions that help us do tasks much more rapidly by using lists. As complicated data structures are simplified by lists, Collegeboard frequently uses the word &quot;abstraction&quot; to describe this function. | . # variable of type string name = &quot;Sri Kotturi&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 16 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Bash&quot;, &quot;html&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[2]&quot;, langs[2], type(langs[2])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . name Sri Kotturi &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; age 16 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; score 90.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; langs [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;, &#39;html&#39;] &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; - langs[2] Java &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; person {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Sri Kotturi&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 16, &#39;score&#39;: 90.0, &#39;langs&#39;: [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;, &#39;html&#39;]} &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; - person[&#34;name&#34;] Sri Kotturi &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . Mathematical Expressions . What is the output of the cell below? What Mathematical Expressions do you see being used? (List them below.) . 10 | addition and division | . grade1 = 10 grade2 = grade1 average_grade = (grade1 + grade2) // 2 #what are these two slashes? The two slashes are used to have the output not consist of decimals, only a whole integer print(average_grade) . 10 . What is the value of num1, num2, and num3? Explain how each number ended up what it was. . num1 is 4096, it is num2 and num3 multiplied | num2 is 455, it is num1 and num3 added up and divided by 9 | num3 is 1, it is num1 mod 5 | . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 ** num3 num3 = num1 % 5 num2 = (num1 + num3) // 9 print(num1) print(num2) print(num3) . 4096 455 1 . Selection . Selection refers to the process of making decisions in a program based on certain conditions. It is normally done with conditional statements. . Allows coders to create programs that make decisions based on input or other factors and respond | . Conditionals . What is a conditional?: . Statement that allows code to execute different instructions if a certain condition is true or false | Allows program to make decisions based on data and input | . What are the main types of conditional statements?: . if | elif | else | . If statements . The if statement is used to check if a certain condition is true. The condition can be any expression that evaulates to a boolean value, True or False. If the condition is True, then it executes a code block. | If (condition) then (consequence) | Example: | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met . x is positive . Else . The else statemnt executes a code block when the if condition is False. | If (condition) then (consequence A), else (consequence B) | . Elif . The elif statement can check multiple conditions in a sequence, and execute a certain block of code if any of the conditions are true. | If (condition) then (consequence A), elif (condition) then (consequence B), else (consequence C) . | Example adding onto the code from before to take negative numbers and 0 into account . | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met elif x &lt; 0: # if previous condition not true... elif condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is negative&quot;)# code that will execute if condition is met else: # everything else, in this case it is if x == 0 print(&quot;x is zero&quot;) # only executes if all previous conditions are not met . x is positive . Nested Conditionals . What is a nested conditional?: . Conditional statement inside another conditional statement | Allows to check for more complex condition where one condition depends on another | . Nested Conditional Statements . Example | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x % 2 == 0: print(&quot;x is even divisible by 2&quot;) # only ever checks is x is divisble by 3 if x is even. nested conditional if x % 3 == 0: print(&quot;x is divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is odd&quot;) . x is odd . Indentation . When using conditionals and nested conditionals in Python, it is important to pay attention to the level of indentation in the code. The code inside the if, elif, and else blocks must be indented so they are nested wihtin the outer statements. This way, Python knows which code belongs to which block. . Binary Search . What is binary search and what is it used for?: . Searching algorithm | Find and select a specific element in a sorted list of elements | . How does binary search work?: . Repeatedly divides the search interval in half to find the middle element and __ the middle value to the target value, if not the same then it continues on to either the lower or upper half | Eliminate half of the remaining search interval elements each time | Efficient way to search for element in large dataset | . What is the time complexity and why?: . O(log(N)) | The maximum number of iterations is the amount of times the list can be divided in half until it reaches 1 number | Dividing by 2, so it is log2(N), logarigthm of n base 2 . | You may recognize the example below from the binary lesson last Friday . | . import random def binary_search_game(): low = 1 high = 100 target = random.randint(low, high) while True: guess = (low + high) // 2 print(f&quot;Is your number {guess}?&quot;) response = input(&quot;Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: &quot;) # conditional statements to check target number and guess if response == &#39;yes&#39;: print(f&quot;I guessed your number {guess}!&quot;) break elif response == &#39;higher&#39;: low = guess + 1 elif response == &#39;lower&#39;: high = guess - 1 else: print(&quot;Invalid input, please enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;.&quot;) binary_search_game() . Is your number 50? Is your number 25? Is your number 12? Is your number 18? Is your number 21? Is your number 23? I guessed your number 23! . Quick Hack . Write a program using conditionals and nested conditionals . Ideas: Quiz, game (rock paper scissors, guess number), etc | . import random options = [&quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot;] user_choice = input(&quot;Choose rock, paper, or scissors: &quot;) computer_choice = random.choice(options) if user_choice == computer_choice: print(&quot;Tie!&quot;) elif user_choice == &quot;rock&quot;: if computer_choice == &quot;paper&quot;: print(&quot;You lose! Paper covers rock.&quot;) else: print(&quot;You win! Rock smashes scissors.&quot;) elif user_choice == &quot;paper&quot;: if computer_choice == &quot;scissors&quot;: print(&quot;You lose! Scissors cut paper.&quot;) else: print(&quot;You win! Paper covers rock.&quot;) else: if computer_choice == &quot;rock&quot;: print(&quot;You lose! Rock smashes scissors.&quot;) else: print(&quot;You win! Scissors cut paper.&quot;) . Tie! . Introduction to Algorithms . an algorithm is a set of instructions that describes how to solve a problem or perform a specific task using a computer program. | It is a precise sequence of computational steps that take an input and produce an output | . How do Algorithms relate to data structures? . Algorithms often rely on specific data structures to solve problems efficiently. | Sorting algorithms require a data structure such as an array or a linked list to store and manipulate data. | Searching algorithms such as binary search require data structures like arrays or trees to organize and search through data. | . Important Terms . What is an algorithm? . it is a finite set of instructions that accomplishes a specific task | Step-by-step process that takes an input, performs steps, and produces output | . Sequencing . means that there is an order in which to do things | It is the order in which steps or instructions are executed by the program | . Selection . Helps to choose two different outcomes based off of a decision that the programmer wants to make | Typically achieved through conditional statements | . Iteration . Repeat something until the condition is met. (also referred to as repetition) | Allows a program to perform the same or similar operations on data, or to perform certain tasks until desired outcome | . Calling and Developing Procedures . A procedure is a sequence of instructions that performs a specific task. | To call a procedure, you need to know its name and any arguments it requires. | When a procedure is called, the program jumps to its instruction and starts executing it. | The arguments passed to a procedure can be used within the procedure to perform tasks or calculations.. | After the procedure has completed its task, it returns control back to the calling program. | . def add_numbers(a, b): sum = a + b print(&quot;The sum of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;is&quot;, sum) # Call the procedure with arguments 5 and 7 add_numbers(5, 7) . The sum of 5 and 7 is 12 . The result of the procedure can be stored in a variable, printed to the screen, or used in any other way that is required by the program. | Procedures can be defined within the same program or in external files, and can be reused across multiple parts of the program. | To avoid errors and improve code readability, it&#39;s important to define and call procedures with proper syntax and conventions that are appropriate for the programming language you&#39;re using. | . def calculate_average(numbers): total = sum(numbers) count = len(numbers) average = total / count return average # Call the procedure with a list of numbers numbers_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] result = calculate_average(numbers_list) # Display the result print(&quot;The average of&quot;, numbers_list, &quot;is&quot;, result) . The average of [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] is 30.0 . Algorithmic Efficiency . Algorithmic efficiency refers to the amount of time and resources needed to execute an algorithm. | The efficiency of an algorithm can be measured in terms of its time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | Space complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | can be analyzed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the worst-case time and space complexity of the algorithm. | . | . What is the time complexity of the following code: . - O(N) - O(N*log(N)) - O(N * Sqrt(N)) - O(N*N) . The time complexity will be O(N*N) because there is a nested for loop - or two for loops consecutively - which causes the time complexity of N to be squared. . a = 0 for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i, N)): a = a + i + j . What will be the time complexity of the following code? . n | (n+1) | n(n-1) | n(n+1) n(n+1) n(n+1) because there are two for loops, and therefore n is iterated through twice. There is also the +1 becaue each time, a value is added by 1. | . value = 0 for i in range(n): #iterates &quot;n&quot; times, with &quot;i&quot; taking on values from 0 to n-1. for j in range(i): # iterates &quot;i&quot; times, with &quot;j&quot; taking on values from 0 to i-1. value=value+1 . Efficiency can be improved by optimizing algorithms or by using more efficient data structures and algorithms. Some common techniques for improving efficiency include reducing the size of the input data, caching results, and parallelizing tasks. | Understanding algorithmic efficiency is important in software development, as it can impact the performance of applications and their ability to scale with larger data sets. | . | . Iteration and Simulations . Simulations are models of real-world phenomena or systems that use mathematical algorithms and computer programs simulate the real behavior and aspects of the subject being modeled. . Simulations are most often used to model complex or time-consuming things that would be difficult to test in real life, such as modeling the spread of diseases in certain ecosystems or testing the functionality of a potential product before it is made. . In this lesson, we will be looking at lists, iteration, and random values through the lens of simulations. . PLEASE RUN THE CODE BELOW BEFORE INTERACTING WITH THE CODE SEGMENTS IN THIS SECTION! . class Card: def __init__(self, suit, val): self.suit = suit self.val = val if val == 11: self.kind = &quot;Ace&quot; elif val == 12: self.kind = &quot;Jack&quot; elif val == 13: self.kind = &quot;Queen&quot; elif val == 14: self.kind = &quot;King&quot; else: self.kind = str(self.val) #return a formatted string version of a card def show(self): return f&quot;{self.kind} of {self.suit}&quot; #adjust aces to prevent breaking def ace_adj(self): if self.kind == &quot;Ace&quot;: self.val = 1 . Review: Lists and Iteration . Lists and iteration work hand-in-hand to efficiently process and/or modify multiple values at once. In a card game, for example, lists and iteration are used together frequently to make the game work correctly. . For Loops . For loops are probably the most well-known type of iterative loop used in code. Most of us know about the for variable in list format. . One helpful tool not a lot of people know about is the enumerate() function. When used in conjunction with a for loop, you can always have access to the index and value of each selected list entry. . numlist = [3, 5, 68, 203] for key, num in enumerate(numlist): print(f&quot;This entry&#39;s index is {str(key)}, but its value is {str(num)}.&quot;) print(f&quot;The difference between the value and the index is {num - key}.&quot;) . This entry&#39;s index is 0, but its value is 3. The difference between the value and the index is 3. This entry&#39;s index is 1, but its value is 5. The difference between the value and the index is 4. This entry&#39;s index is 2, but its value is 68. The difference between the value and the index is 66. This entry&#39;s index is 3, but its value is 203. The difference between the value and the index is 200. . QUESTION: How is the key, num in enumerate(list) format similar to the format used when applying a for loop to a dictionary? . Answer: A for loop iterates over the keys and values of a dictionary when it is applied. Similar to how dictionaries&#39; keys and values iterate through their entries, this format does the same with its index and values. . List Comprehension . You may also see for loops used within a list like below. We went over this in class fairly recently. In this case, it is used to show the cards in the hand of a player. . player_hand = [] # the player&#39;s hand is represented as a list # because lists are mutable (can change), they can be added to, like drawing a card # assume the deck below is a a deck of shuffled cards deck = [Card(&quot;Hearts&quot;, 3), Card(&quot;Spades&quot;, 12), Card(&quot;Diamonds&quot;, 11)] def draw_card(hand, deck): hand.append(deck.pop()) #try it out draw_card(player_hand, deck) print([card.show() for card in player_hand]) . [&#39;Ace of Diamonds&#39;] . Recursive Loops . Recursive loops have you calling one function inside of another. If a function must make some change to a certain value multiple times, it is oftem most efficient to have a function call itself with slightly different arguments like the fibonacci sequence below. . def fibonacci(terms): if terms &lt;= 1: return terms return fibonacci(terms-1) + fibonacci(terms-2) fibonacci(5) . 5 . Nesting Loops . Nesting loops increases the time complexity of the program, but it can be used to do things like make a card deck (see below). . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): #HINT: try replacing this function deck.append(Card(suit, val)) . While Loops . While loops aren&#39;t used in the program, but they offer a different way to repeat a set of instructions in a program. The procedure below the while [condition] line will occur until the condition is made not true. . Student Interaction: How could this build function be altered to function with a while loop within it? . A while loop could be used to run only when val is in the range 2 and 15, like while val&lt;15 and while val&gt;2. . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): deck.append(Card(suit, val)) #HINT: you may want to make an incrementing i variable . While loops also alter an alternative way to loop a set of instructions forever, until a precise thing occurs to break the loop. See the code below. . import random i = 0 while True: i += 1 ch = random.randint(1, 11) if ch == 10: print(f&quot;It took {str(i)} random generations to get 10.&quot;) break . 49 random generations is a lot more than it would normally take, but it&#39;s important for code to be able to model unlikely, yet possible scenarios. Speaking of random values... . Random Values . Because unpredictable randomness occurs in the real world, it&#39;s important to have a way to represent it. Simulations are able to use randomization, which could be in the form of random number generation or other methods like shuffle. . Card decks are a great example of how random values can be used to represent real-world scenarios. In the card simulation, the random module&#39;s shuffle function is used to quite literally shuffle the deck, seen below. . def shuffle(deck): random.shuffle(deck) . Often, random selection methods use functions like randint or randrange as ways to select certain indexes in lists, or might use the random numbers in some other way. . QUESTION: Without shuffling the card order of the deck, can you think of a way that the aforementioned random module functions could be used to get a random card from the deck? Do so in the code cell below. . import random suits = [&quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Spades&quot;] ranks = [&quot;Ace&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, &quot;King&quot;] deck = [(rank, suit) for suit in suits for rank in ranks] random_card = random.choice(deck) print(&quot;Random card from the deck:&quot;, random_card) . Random card from the deck: (&#39;Jack&#39;, &#39;Hearts&#39;) . Simulation Homework . Now that you&#39;ve learned about simulations and how they&#39;re used, it&#39;s time to apply that knowledge by creating a (basic) simulation of a real-world scenario. It can be something in nature, like the changes in the wildlife population of a certain area; it can be a game, like Uno (no blackjack though, that&#39;s taken); or it can be something completely random and unique. . The simulation must include... .

Databases . We have already gone over databases in this class, but here is a refresher. A database contains data that&#39;s stored in columns and rows. The information in this database can then be pulled from the database and can be used in a program. . Setting Up the Database . Run the code cell below to prepare SQLite to create the database. If your system is struggling with the flask functions, verify that you&#39;re in the correct Python environment. REMEMBER: You should only db.init_app(app) ONCE during the process! . from flask import Flask from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy # Setup of key Flask object (app) app = Flask(__name__) # Setup SQLAlchemy object and properties for the database (db) database = &#39;sqlite:///sqlite.db&#39; # path and filename of database app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&#39;] = False app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = database app.config[&#39;SECRET_KEY&#39;] = &#39;SECRET_KEY&#39; db = SQLAlchemy() # This belongs in place where it runs once per project db.init_app(app) . The Model File . The model file plays a crucial role in the formation of the database. . The model helps to create new databases | It provides a standardized method for formating the database entries across different systems | Objects used within the database are created | . import os, base64 import json from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError # Define the User class to manage actions in the &#39;users&#39; table class User(db.Model): __tablename__ = &#39;players&#39; # table name is plural, class name is singular # Define the User schema with &quot;vars&quot; from object id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) _username = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=False, nullable=False) _streak = db.Column(db.Integer, unique=True, nullable=False) # constructor of a User object, initializes the instance variables within object (self) def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._streak = streak # a username getter method, extracts username from object @property def username(self): return self._username # a setter function, allows username to be updated after initial object creation @username.setter def username(self, username): self._username = username # a getter method, extracts streak from object @property def streak(self): return self._streak # a setter function, allows streak to be updated after initial object creation @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak # output content using str(object) in human readable form, uses getter # output content using json dumps, this is ready for API response def __str__(self): return json.dumps(self.read()) # CRUD create/add a new record to the table # returns self or None on error def create(self): try: # creates a person object from User(db.Model) class, passes initializers db.session.add(self) # add prepares to persist person object to Users table db.session.commit() # SqlAlchemy &quot;unit of work pattern&quot; requires a manual commit return self except IntegrityError: db.session.remove() return None # CRUD read converts self to dictionary # returns dictionary def read(self): return { &quot;id&quot;: self.id, &quot;username&quot;: self.username, &quot;streak&quot;: self.streak } # CRUD update: updates user name, password, phone # returns self def update(self, username, streak): &quot;&quot;&quot;only updates values with length&quot;&quot;&quot; if len(username) &gt; 0: self.username = username if streak &gt; 0: self.streak = streak db.session.commit() return self # CRUD delete: remove self # None def delete(self): db.session.delete(self) db.session.commit() return None &quot;&quot;&quot;Database Creation and Testing &quot;&quot;&quot; # Builds working data for testing def initUsers(): with app.app_context(): &quot;&quot;&quot;Create database and tables&quot;&quot;&quot; db.create_all() &quot;&quot;&quot;Tester data for table&quot;&quot;&quot; u1 = User(username=&quot;Mr. Cards&quot;, streak=5) u2 = User(username=&quot;Kard Kowntre&quot;, streak=10) u3 = User(username=&quot;Un Bea Table&quot;, streak=15) users = [u1, u2, u3] &quot;&quot;&quot;Builds sample user/note(s) data&quot;&quot;&quot; for user in users: try: user.create() print(f&#39;Created user with username &quot;{user.username}&quot;.&#39;) except IntegrityError: &#39;&#39;&#39;fails with bad or duplicate data&#39;&#39;&#39; db.session.remove() print(f&quot;Records exist, duplicate email, or error: {user.username}&quot;) . The init Fuction . The init method has one purpose which is to initialize the object&#39;s attributes. This is what is known as the constructor. In our project, the init method initalizes the username and streak as variables. . def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._score = streak . Setters and Getters . Setters and Getters are important methods used when writing code for databases. . Setter: a method that allows us to set or change the value of an attribute in a class. | Getter: a method that allows us to access an attribute in a given class. | . Setter Example . @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak . Getter Example . @property def streak(self): return self._streak . The Api File . An API is an important part of having a functional database. . it acts as a messenger that allows programs to access data from the others | it connects all information | for a database, an api retrieves the data requested in code for the user | . import json from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building user_api = Blueprint(&#39;user_api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/users&#39;) api = Api(user_api) class UserAPI: class _CRUD(Resource): # User API operation for Create, Read. THe Update, Delete methods need to be implemeented def post(self): # Create method &#39;&#39;&#39; Read data for json body &#39;&#39;&#39; body = request.get_json() &#39;&#39;&#39; Avoid garbage in, error checking &#39;&#39;&#39; # validate name username = body.get(&#39;username&#39;) if username is None or len(username) &lt; 1: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Username is missing, or is less than a character&#39;}, 400 # validate uid streak = body.get(&#39;streak&#39;) if streak is None or streak &lt; 1: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Streak is missing, or is less than 1&#39;}, 400 &#39;&#39;&#39; #1: Key code block, setup USER OBJECT &#39;&#39;&#39; uo = User(username=username, streak=streak) &#39;&#39;&#39; #2: Key Code block to add user to database &#39;&#39;&#39; # create user in database user = uo.create() # success returns json of user if user: return jsonify(user.read()) # failure returns error return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Processed {username}, either a format error or a duplicate&#39;}, 400 def get(self): # Read Method users = User.query.all() # read/extract all users from database json_ready = [user.read() for user in users] # prepare output in json return jsonify(json_ready) # jsonify creates Flask response object, more specific to APIs than json.dumps def put(self): body = request.get_json() # get the body of the request id = body.get(&#39;id&#39;) username = body.get(&#39;username&#39;) streak = body.get(&#39;streak&#39;) # get the UID (Know what to reference) user = User.query.get(id) # get the player (using the uid in this case) user.update(username=username, streak=streak) return f&quot;{user.read()} Updated&quot; def delete(self): body = request.get_json() id = body.get(&#39;id&#39;) player = User.query.get(id) player.delete() return f&quot;{player.read()} Has been deleted&quot; # building RESTapi endpoint api.add_resource(_CRUD, &#39;/&#39;) . This is important particularly in a full flask respository context, but in this case, you&#39;ll just need to run the initUsers() function. . initUsers() . Created user with username &#34;Mr. Cards&#34;. Created user with username &#34;Kard Kowntre&#34;. Created user with username &#34;Un Bea Table&#34;. . An Alternative Method of Making SQLite Databases . In a previous lesson, we went over using the cursor object in SQLite3. Rather than go over all of that here, this lesson goes over it thoroughly. (You may use this method for the homework below.) . Database Homework . For this assignment, we&#39;d like you to make your own database file as instructed above. Remember, the API file isn&#39;t necessary in this case; you&#39;ll be focusing on making the model and the init function. . Your database must include these things: . A class with at least four attributes (if not the cursor method) | Setters and getters for this class (if not the cursor method) | Each of the CRUD functions | An init function with at least four entries | A screenshot showing proof that your SQLite file has been created correctly | . Feel free to base your database on the model provided above! Ask our group if you have any questions or concerns. . import os, base64 import json from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError # Define the User class to manage actions in the &#39;users&#39; table class Game(db.Model): __tablename__ = &#39;games&#39; # table name is plural, class name is singular # Define the User schema with &quot;vars&quot; from object id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) _name = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=False, nullable=False) _score = db.Column(db.Integer, unique=False, nullable=False) _wins = db.Column(db.Integer, unique=False, nullable=False) # constructor of a User object, initializes the instance variables within object (self) def __init__(self, name, score, wins): self._name = name self._score = score self._wins = wins # a name getter method, extracts name from object @property def name(self): return self._name # a setter function, allows name to be updated after initial object creation @name.setter def name(self, name): self._name = name # a getter method, extracts score from object @property def score(self): return self._score # a setter function, allows score to be updated after initial object creation @score.setter def score(self, score): self._score = score @property def wins(self): return self._wins @wins.setter def wins(self, wins): self._wins = wins # output content using str(object) in human readable form, uses getter # output content using json dumps, this is ready for API response def __str__(self): return json.dumps(self.read()) # CRUD create/add a new record to the table # returns self or None on error def create(self): try: # creates a person object from User(db.Model) class, passes initializers db.session.add(self) # add prepares to persist person object to Users table db.session.commit() # SqlAlchemy &quot;unit of work pattern&quot; requires a manual commit return self except IntegrityError: db.session.remove() return None def read(self): return { &quot;id&quot;: self.id, &quot;name&quot;: self.name, &quot;score&quot;: self.score, &quot;wins&quot;: self.wins } def update(self, name, score, wins): &quot;&quot;&quot;only updates values with length&quot;&quot;&quot; if len(name) &gt; 0: self.name = name if score &gt;= 0: self.score = score if wins &gt;= 0: self.wins = wins db.session.commit() return self def delete(self): db.session.delete(self) db.session.commit() return None &quot;&quot;&quot;Database Creation and Testing &quot;&quot;&quot; def initGame(): with app.app_context(): &quot;&quot;&quot;Create database and tables&quot;&quot;&quot; db.create_all() &quot;&quot;&quot;Tester data for table&quot;&quot;&quot; u1 = Game(name=&quot;Alice&quot;, score=3, wins=1) u2 = Game(name=&quot;Bob&quot;, score=0, wins=0) u3 = Game(name=&quot;Tim&quot;, score=0, wins=0) u4 = Game(name=&quot;Robert&quot;, score=0, wins=0) users = [u1, u2, u3, u4] &quot;&quot;&quot;Builds sample user/note(s) data&quot;&quot;&quot; for user in users: try: user.create() print(f&#39;Created user with name &quot;{user.name}&quot;.&#39;) except IntegrityError: &#39;&#39;&#39;fails with bad or duplicate data&#39;&#39;&#39; db.session.remove() print(f&quot;Records exist, duplicate email, or error: {user.name}&quot;) . Grading . Your submission will be graded based on the following criteria: . Filling in the blank throughout the lesson and providing code in the given cells when applicable (0.9) | Simulation homework (0.9) | Database homework (0.9) | . Here are some ideas for ways to increase your score above a 2.7: . Make a frontend version of your simulation that can be interacted with on your blog | Connect your simulation to the database you create | Create a menu that allows a user to make an entry in your database (CRUD functions within it) | You can establish a relationship between two classes/tables in your database (see the relationship between the User and Note classes in the Nighthawk Coders flask repository) | . .",

            "title": "SASS",
            "content": "Why SASS? . SASS is an improvement on CSS in that there are methods of abstraction. It is a stylesheet language that is compiled into CSS, which means that Sass will translate the Sass code you wrote into CSS, which is what your web browser can read. . SASS vs SCSS . As you learn about Sass, you might notice something called Scss. They are basically the same thing except that Scss uses curly braces and semicolons to distinguish between lines. Sass uses indentation and newlines instead. . We will be teaching the Scss syntax because it is more commonly used. . Getting started . A easy way to write SASS and have it preprocessed into CSS is by using a Jekyll powered website, such as GitHub pages or Fastpages. . The first step is to clone a GitHub pages repo, such as this one. . Within the repository, head over to assets/css/, and open style.scss. . This is where you can create your SASS code. . To see your CSS-translated SASS code, head over to _site/assets/css/style.css . Note: You will need to run bundle exec jekyll serve before the _site directory appears. . The first few hundred lines are used to style Github&#39;s theme. Make sure to scroll to the very bottom to see the SASS code that you wrote, which is in the form of CSS. . Nesting . The same element may be shared by several separate selectors and objects. | You can write the styling code in a heirarchy by using nesting. | . Mini-hack . Write out the SASS equivalent for the following CSS code: . .a .b { color: green; } .a .c { color: blue; } . SASS: . .a { .b { color: green; .c { color: blue; }}} . Extend/Inheritance . What are some similarities that the buttons share? What are the differences? . The width and height of each button are the same. | Additionally, the font size and color are identical. | The button spacing is likewise comparable. | The buttons&#39; backgrounds have various hues. | . Mixin . generates a reusable code template | can also accept parameters, allowing for the use of dynamic styling | @mixin is used to create a mixin, and @include is used to call it. | . Mini-hack . Write out a mixin in SASS that takes in a color and a font size as the parameter. Within the mixin, set the background color and font color to the color parameter, and set the font size to the font size parameter. Then create a selector that calls the mixin, and pass in a color and font size of your choice as the arguments. . @mixin color-and-font($color, $font-size) { background-color: $color; color: $color; font-size: $font-size; } .my-class { @include color-and-font(#008000, 16px); } . Function . can be produced using @function in SASS. | It has the same format as a Python function, functionName(Parameters). | Additionally, brackets should follow, just like in a JavaScript function. | by including the function name in parenthesis when calling them. Define the arguments that the function will accept as parameters between parenthesis. | . | . Import . Code written in SASS can be imported into one file from numerous files. | Make a directory called &quot;_sass&quot;, for instance. | Here, you can generate numerous files, including &#39;style.scss&#39; and &#39;color.scss&#39; Use the command @import &quot;style&quot; to import the code from &#39;style.scss&#39; into &#39;color.scss&#39;. There must be quotation marks around the function name and the &#39;.scss&#39; is not required. | . SASS Hacks . Take notes and complete the mini-hacks. (0.9) . | Complete the quiz questions and provide your answers in this notebook. (0.9) . | Use SASS to create something that uses either extend or mixin.

More points will be given if both are done. . | B | A | C | B | D | B | B | Variables: . permits users to specify values | is useful for specifying things like colors, font sizes, margins, padding values, and more. | . Partial SASS files: . Partial SASS files that contain small code segments | Name with an underscore like partial.scss | A much more efficient way to organize code | Can be incorporated in multiple other files | Examples of control directives are: | @if, @for, and @each. | These allow us to create loops and conditional statements, as well as iteration. | .

In this program, the binary operations &amp; (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), and ~ (NOT) are used to perform the binary operations on the input numbers. The results are stored in separate variables as binary numbers. Then, the binary_operations function is used to convert each decimal result to binary, and the binary strings are stored in separate variables. Finally, the program returns a tuple of tuples, with each inner tuple containing both the decimal and binary result for each operation. The outer tuple is unpacked into separate variables for printing, and the results are displayed as both decimal and binary. . def binary_operations(num1, num2): # Perform the binary operations and_result_decimal = num1 &amp; num2 or_result_decimal = num1 | num2 xor_result_decimal = num1 ^ num2 not_result_decimal = ~num1 # Convert results to binary and_result_binary = bin(and_result_decimal)[2:] or_result_binary = bin(or_result_decimal)[2:] xor_result_binary = bin(xor_result_decimal)[2:] not_result_binary = bin(not_result_decimal)[2:] # Return the results as a tuple of tuples return ((and_result_decimal, and_result_binary), (or_result_decimal, or_result_binary), (xor_result_decimal, xor_result_binary), (not_result_decimal, not_result_binary)) # Ask the user for input num1 = int(input(&quot;Enter the first number: &quot;)) num2 = int(input(&quot;Enter the second number: &quot;)) # Call the binary_operations function and print the results and_result, or_result, xor_result, not_result = binary_operations(num1, num2) print(&quot;AND result: decimal =&quot;, and_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, and_result[1]) print(&quot;OR result: decimal =&quot;, or_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, or_result[1]) print(&quot;XOR result: decimal =&quot;, xor_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, xor_result[1]) print(&quot;NOT result: decimal =&quot;, not_result[0], &quot;, binary =&quot;, not_result[1]) .

Binary to String Conversion . This program defines a string_to_binary function that takes a string as input and returns the binary representation of the string. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the string. For each character, the ord function is used to get its ASCII code, which is then converted to binary using the format function with the &#39;08b&#39; format specifier to ensure that each binary number is 8 digits long. The resulting binary numbers are concatenated to form the final binary string. . . # Function to convert a string to binary def string_to_binary(string): binary = &#39;&#39; for char in string: binary += format(ord(char), &#39;08b&#39;) # Convert the character to binary and append to the binary string return binary # Example usage word = input(&quot;Enter a word to convert to binary: &quot;) binary_word = string_to_binary(word) print(f&quot;The binary representation of &#39;{word}&#39; is {binary_word}&quot;) . The binary representation of &#39;parav&#39; is 0111000001100001011100100110000101110110 . Many programs use binary conversion, particularly those related to computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics. Programs that rely on binary conversion include:&gt; - Networking: Programs that deal with network addresses, such as IP addresses and subnet masks, use binary conversion to represent and manipulate the addresses.&gt; - Cryptography:Programs that deal with encryption and decryption use binary conversion to encode and decode data.&gt; - Computer Hardware:Programs that interface with computer hardware, such as drivers and firmware, often use binary conversion to communicate with the hardware at the binary level.&gt; - Mathematical Applications:Programs that deal with complex calculations and mathematical analysis, such as statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms, may use binary conversion to represent large numbers or complex data sets.&gt; - Finance:Programs that deal with financial calculations and accounting may use binary conversion to represent fractional amounts or complex financial data. . Binary Search .

Binary search operates a lot like a &quot;guess the number&quot; game. Try the game and explain how the two are similar. . import random hid = random.randint(0,100) gues = 0 def game(): global gues gues += 1 num = int(input(&#39;Pick a number&#39;)) if num &lt; hid: print(&#39;higher&#39;) game() if num &gt; hid: print(&#39;lower&#39;) game() if num == hid: print(hid) print(&#39;You Win !!!&#39;) print(&#39;guesses: &#39;, gues) game() . higher higher lower higher higher higher lower 83 You Win !!! guesses: 8 . They are comparable in that both determine whether the objective is higher or lower than either the midpoint (binary search) or the hidden number (guess game). Essentially, binary search is how you win in the guess the number game. Because it is in the middle, you should guess 50 first. If your guess is higher or lower than 50, move on to your next guess, which should be 25. . Logic Gates . Accepts inputs and then outputs a result based on what the inputs were .

(0.9) . | . Applying Binary Math - Calculator Hack . Calculators use binary math to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.In a calculator, the binary digits are represented by electronic switches that can be either on or off, corresponding to 1 or 0 respectively. These switches are arranged in groups of eight to form bytes, which are used to represent larger numbers. When a user enters a number into a calculator, the number is converted into binary form and stored in the calculator&#39;s memory.To perform an arithmetic operation, the calculator retrieves the numbers from its memory and performs the operation using binary math. . For example, to add the binary numbers 1010 and 1101, the calculator would perform the following steps:&gt; 1. Add the rightmost digits, 0 and 1, which gives a sum of 1.&gt; 2. Move to the next digit to the left and add the digits along with any carry from the previous step. In this case, we have 1 + 0 + 1, which gives a sum of 10. The carry of 1 is then carried over to the next digit. . Repeat step 2 for the remaining digits until all digits have been added. | The result of the addition in this example is the binary number 10111, which is equivalent to the decimal number 23. | Similarly, subtraction, multiplication, and division are performed using binary math. The algorithms for these operations are based on the same principles as those used in decimal arithmetic, but with binary digits and powers of 2 instead of decimal digits and powers of 10. . def binary_math(num1, num2, operator): # convert binary inputs to integers num1_int = int(num1, 2) num2_int = int(num2, 2) # operators if operator == &#39;+&#39;: result_int = num1_int + num2_int elif operator == &#39;-&#39;: result_int = num1_int - num2_int elif operator == &#39;*&#39;: result_int = num1_int * num2_int elif operator == &#39;/&#39;: result_int = num1_int // num2_int else: print(&quot;Invalid operator&quot;) return # convert the result back to binary and return it return bin(result_int)[2:] num1 = input(&quot;Enter the first binary number: &quot;) num2 = input(&quot;Enter the second binary number: &quot;) operator = input(&quot;Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): &quot;) # call the binary_math function to print the ending result result = binary_math(num1, num2, operator) print(&quot;Result:&quot;, result) .

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1), also considered constant time. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. .

Taylor Swift Extra Credit . My favorite Taylor Swift song is &quot;Shake It Off,&quot; which was released in 2014, from the album &#39;1989&#39;. My taste of music is more upbeat and catchy music with strong lyrical music, and Taylor Swift killed it with this song, as she shows traits of resilience and self confidence. . Swift talks about the negative comments she received in her life and expresses it through this song, encouraging her audience to &quot;shake it off&quot; and not be let down of yourself through other people&#39;s words. This is very reasonable for any audience, but as a highschooler, I feel that this song truly important as you can receive lots of hate from other students, but you have to not let it affect you, which is something I have learned from this song. &quot;Shake It Off&quot; encourages listeners to keep going and not give up, which can be a powerful message for young people who are still figuring out their place in the world, such as highschoolers like me. . Overall, &quot;Shake It Off&quot; is my favorite Taylor Swift song because of its catchy beat, uplifting message, and relatable themes of self-confidence and resilience. This song was one of the first song&#39;s I&#39;ve listened to from a young little kid and is the primary reason of why I enjoy listening to music nowadays. .",

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? | . Writing effective algorithms can considerably enhance software systems&#39; performance and scalability, which is crucial for producing high-quality and user-friendly applications. .

Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . Although there are two issues, space complexity is ultimately the bigger one. Space complexity is a bigger issue because larger images consume more memory and space. Time complexity is a result of space complexity; the bigger the image, the longer it takes for the program to run. | . Big O Notation .

Constant O(1) . No matter how big something gets, we can go to it instantly . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[23]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;, 2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 23 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1).

Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) .

Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i, j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) #print(fibonacci(30)) print(fibonacci(40)) . 102334155 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) print(generate_subsets([1,2,3,4,5,6])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) # This would be huge .

Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. . Processing times that are quadratic are preferable than those that are linear. | The use of logarithms in huge spaces is effective. | Explicit exponential is effective in tiny spaces. | . Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. . The measurement of algorithm performance and efficiency using time and space complexity is crucial since it can have a big impact on how scaleable and useful software is. Algorithms for sorting can be classified into a number of categories, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Fast Sort, and Heap Sort. These algorithms take varied amounts of time to complete. As they have an average time complexity of O(n*logn) compared to Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort&#39;s time complexity of O(n2), Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort are typically seen as being more efficient. | . Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? . The efficiency of the algorithm, which in turn influences the program&#39;s overall performance in terms of speed, scalability, and resource consumption, is a critical factor to take into account while choosing an algorithm. The program&#39;s performance and efficiency can be greatly enhanced by selecting an algorithm with a reduced time and space complexity. | . Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? . No, it is not always necessary or possible to employ constant time algorithms because some problems require more complicated solutions that may include more time or space complexity. Weighing the benefits and drawbacks of using an exponential time method is crucial to determining whether it is practicable and realistic for the specific problem and the input quantity. | . What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? . The time and space complexity of an algorithm are typically associated, with greater time complexity algorithms typically requiring more space complexity to complete the task and vice versa. Big O notation, which offers an upper bound on an algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity as a function of input size, is frequently used to represent this correlation. | . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice . a = 0 b = 0 for i in range(N): a = a + random() for i in range(M): b= b + random() . O(N * M) time, O(1) space | O(N + M) time, O(N + M) space O(N + M) time, O(1) space | | O(N * M) time, O(N + M) space | Correct answer:3 The first loop is O(N) and the second loop is O(M). Since N and M are independent variables, so we can’t say which one is the leading term. Therefore Time complexity of the given problem will be O(N+M). Since variables size does not depend on the size of the input, therefore Space Complexity will be constant or O(1) . 2. What is the time complexity of the following code: . a = 0; for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i,N)): a = a + i + j; . O(N) | O(N*log(N)) | O(N * Sqrt(N)) O(N*N) | | Correct answer:4 These are nested for loops, which were the exact example of quadratic time complexity we learned in class, so I was pretty easily able to identify it as quadratic, or O(N*N). . 3. What is the time complexity of the following code: . k = 0; for i in range(n//2,n): for j in range(2,n,pow(2,j)): k = k + n / 2; . O(N) O(N*log(N)) | | (n^2) | O(n^2Logn) | Correct answer:2 The outside loop is linear and the inside loop is logarithmic, so you&#39;d simply multiply them inside the O notation . 4. What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y? . X will always be a better choice for small inputs X will always be a better choice for large inputs | | Y will always be a better choice for small inputs | X will always be a better choice for all inputs | Correct answer:2 For large inputs, X&#39;s time or space complexity grows slower than Y&#39;s time or space complexity . 5. What is the time complexity of the following code: . a = 0 i = N while (i &gt; 0): a += i i //= 2 . O(N) | O(Sqrt(N)) | O(N / 2) | O(LogN) | Correct answer:4 I thought it was linear because there&#39;s only one loop, but its logarithmic because the program is essentially a binary search. . 6. Which of the following best describes the useful criterion for comparing the efficiency of algorithms? . Time | Memory Both of the above | | None of the above | Correct answer:3 Comparing the efficiency of an algorithm depends on the time and memory taken by an algorithm. The algorithm which runs in lesser time and takes less memory even for a large input size is considered a more efficient algorithm. . 7. How is time complexity measured? . By counting the number of algorithms in an algorithm. By counting the number of primitive operations performed by the algorithm on a given input size. | | By counting the size of data input to the algorithm. | None of the above | Correct answer:2 . 8. What will be the time complexity of the following code? . for i in range(n): i=i*k . O(N) | O(k) O(logkn) | | O(lognk) | Correct answer:3 The base of the log has to be k and that leads to the n being the value in the parentheses. . 9. What will be the time complexity of the following code? . value = 0; for i in range(n): for j in range(i): value=value+1 . n | (n+1) n(n-1) | | n(n+1) | Correct answer:3 First for loop will run for (n) times and another for loop will be run for (n-1) times as the inner loop will only run till the range i which is 1 less than n , so overall time will be n(n-1). . 10. Algorithm A and B have a worst-case running time of O(n) and O(logn), respectively. Therefore, algorithm B always runs faster than algorithm A. . True False | | Correct answer 2 . The Big-O notation provides an asymptotic comparison in the running time of algorithms. For n &lt; n0​​, algorithm A might run faster than algorithm B. .",

It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

D is correct. In order for the robot to move from the gray square back to its original position, it must move forward two squares, turn right, move forward four squares, turn left, and move forward two squares. The same set of moves can be used in both directions, so no change is needed to the algorithm. . Q49 Correction . . B is correct. Simulations are limited by the model that is used.

Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? While binary and hexadecimals are not typically utilized for photographs, Base64 is. While the bases for binary and hexadecimal are 8 and 16, respectively, Base64 is the term used to describe how binary data is converted to text. . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. cGFy | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? Many times, mostly while using my phone or watching football, I have encountered buffering. | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? Buffering occurs if there is a large amount of data, users, and inputs. While I am watching a video or a movie, the video frequently doesn&#39;t load because it is buffering. A game I&#39;m playing occasionally may lag and buffer, especially if a lot of animations are displayed. Even a livestream to watch a game will have buffering and may cause me to be behind. | How do these effects apply to images? The larger the image or the more animations on an image, the more likely the buffering. | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? Yes, it is called an Imperative program. | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? A colored image becomes a de-saturated image as a result. Depending on the luminance of each pixel&#39;s color, it extracts the color information from each pixel and converts it to a shade of grey. | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? An image&#39;s size and pixel density are altered when it is scaled. As an illustration, upscaling typically results in quality loss since a high pixel density is blown out to a bigger size or a lower density. | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Yes, scaling an image is comparable to the College Board term &quot;data compression&quot; in that it shrinks the file size by reducing the number of pixels. Scaling is a sort of lossy compression. | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Smile Emoji&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;smiley.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39;

After the user keeps guessing until they sink all 3 ships, the game will tell the user how many attempts it took for them to sink al 3. Then their score will be used to help them input their data in the leaderboard and will be stored. The leaderboard will adjust using update and delete to make sure the leaderboard stays up to date with all users. . 3.A.iii: The inputs are all clicks by the player and they can have different outputs such as hit, miss, or sunk based on the randomized placements of the ships. If you click on a square which does not have a ship on it, it will show a big ‘X’ and let the user know that it was a miss. If you click on a square which does have a ship on it, it will show a ship diagram and let the user know it was a hit. And if 3 ships in a row were to be hit, then it would let the user know that the ship has been sunk.

There is no purposeful exclusion, but the content on TikTok is made to catch the eyes of teenagers using the idea of short videos instead of posts of moments in life. Both apps are harmful for people as they can defeat someone’s self-esteem and make them feel less confident through other’s Facebook posts, while TikTok could have rude and uncomforting short videos of people that could affect other’s mental health. It could be corrected by having stricter guidelines and more employees or bots reviewing over videos. This is good business as it creates interest and addiction to users. . | Virtual assistants have female voices because people have lots of data from older times of women talking and they use that for the smart technology nowadays as there is still a way for users to switch it to male voices. This could also be because men have a deeper voice and can be harder to hear at times especially with background noises as women tend to have a higher pitched voice. This isn’t necessarily harmful as it isn’t really a big deal as it most likely is due to old data stored of women talking and could be corrected like the solution that has been made now with having multiple options of voices. . | The recommendation algorithm used by Netflix and Amazon to provide personalized content or goods is an illustration of an algorithm that influences decisions.

This could be taken as harmful to some people as they may think that this could have been intentionally designed although there would be no good reason or advantage for HP to create something like this. . | .

Program Purpose and Function | Describes the purpose of the program, describes the program’s functionality, and can take an input and return an output. | The purpose of this program is to provide the user with an entertaining and competitive experience through the gameplay of several virtual games like chess and battleship along with a game history page where users are able to view previous games and view an analysis of the gameplay. | . Data Abstraction | Shows how data has been stored in a collection and shows data from that collection as it contributes to the overall purpose of the program. Identifies the name of a variable representing the collection being used and describes what the data contained in the collection represents in the program. | Our program abstracts data through the creation of records that are accessed in a backend database. The purpose of this database is to store crucial information about a user such as the moves inputted and previous gameplay. This value can be used in our program to construct a history of games with the login information that they use for their account. We will also store a UserID, Name, and Password to identify users and authenticate their account to be able to save gameplay and revisit it. | . Managing Complexity | Shows a collection of data that manages complexity. Explains an alternative method that would have been more complex and explains why that method could not be used or how it would have to be written differently. | There will be multiple ways that we have complexity in our website as we have a variety of different games that will be functioning and live with another local player. This allows a unique variety of code as well and is all managed under the category of games. | . Procedural Abstraction | Shows a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure, and shows where that procedure is called. Describes how the procedure contributes to the functionality of the program. | This may be found in every game we create because they are all sufficiently complex to need a function with a parameter. | . Algorithm Implementation | Includes a student-developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. Explains how the algorithm works in detail enough to where someone could recreate it. | The games we create for the online arcade will have enough algorithms to satisfy this need. | . Testing | Describe two calls to the selected procedure in response 3c. Each call must pass a argument that causes different outputs. Describes conditions being tested by each call. Identifies the result of each call. | In each game, we’ll test two distinct features that examine various aspects of the java backend and produce various outputs. | . We must complete all project requirements, including appropriateness and the demonstration of programming abilities through a written report and a video, as part of the College Board performance assignments. To demonstrate mastery of the project and the AP CSP curriculum, this includes demonstrating the program’s function and purpose, managing complexity, applying algorithms and procedures, testing, and providing thorough descriptions. For our CPT group project, we have been developing a website that resembles an arcade where users may connect and play chess or battleship with other players. It will contain a variety of gaming elements, including moves, victories, and user impacts. Additionally, there will be a need that individuals sign in before playing so that their profile can reflect their victories and losses.

            "content": "Total Score: . . Incorrect Answers . Question 11 . . Option C was incorrect. If input B is false, the resulting value coming out of the OR gate will be true (since the value of A is true). Since the value of C is true, the resulting value coming out of the AND gate is true. This result contradicts the statement. Therefore, Option A was correct. . Question 12 . . I read the options too fast and didn’t realize that option A was including both (onFloor1 AND callTo2) AND (onFloor2 AND callTo1) instead of OR. Therefore Option B was correct. . Question 14 . . Option D is incorrect because if A is inputted then it will lead to an OR situation which than could become a true statement. Therefore Option A is the correct answer because input A directly outputs true. . Question 15 . . Option D is correct because the robot will get stuck on the 5th and 6th block which will create a constant loop where the robot will move back and forth. Therefore this leads to Option A being wrong. . Question 17 . . I only selected one answer when there were 2 correct answers. Option D is also correct because the result &lt;– is on the outside which helps create the same output as the top one shown. . Question 27 . . The n&lt;–n+1 occurs after the entire repeating code because with Option C, it does it before the repeating which makes it do an extra move every time unnecessarily when it is meant to happen after to lead to the right spot . Question 28 . . This option is correct. After one iteration of the ‘Repeat 2 times’ loop, the robot will end up in the upper-right square facing to the left. After the second iteration of the Repeat 2 times loop, the robot will end up in the upper-left square facing down. The robot has finished in the gray square. . Question 30 . . Option B is correct instead of Option A because the draw circle command should come after the variables values have been calculated because then it will know with what dimensions to draw the circle. . Question 41 . . This option is incorrect. The statement ‘Random (1 , 10)’ could evaluate to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. There is a one out of 10, or 10 percent, chance that it could evaluate to 2. If this happens, the value of ‘sum’ is increased by 1, which simulates a person voting for the candidate. This does not match the goal of the program, which is to simulate an election in which a certain candidate is expected to receive 20 percent of the vote. . Question 43 . . Computer simulations don’t necessarily have to be once the real-world object has been created. Computer simulations usually make some simplifying assumptions about the real-world object or system being modeled. . Question 45 . . This answer is wrong because it doesn’t make sense that a heuristic solution would be useful when the problem can be solved in a reasonable time, since you’re better off trying to actually solve the problem then. . Question 47 . . This option is incorrect. A heuristic is a technique that can find an approximate solution more quickly when exact methods are too slow. Calculating a grade can be done exactly and quickly by a program. Option C is correct because finding the shortest driving route is an optimization problem that cannot be solved in a reasonable time, and a heuristic is a technique that can find an approximate solution more quickly when exact methods are too slow. .",

Testing | 1 | 1 | Each call’s requirements and every call’s output are specified in detail, along with the expected outcome. | . Reflection 1 . The results and grades matched with mine. As there are more projects, I am better able to fully understand the standards set by Collegeboard and am better able to determine whether or not something earns points. Overall, this CPT project has some strong components, but the list and code are where they really fell short because of how lacking they were and how they neglected to include key crucial components. . Submission 2 Grading Student Scoring CB Grading Additional Comments . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The goal of the program for a word game is made clear, and the game’s intended outcome is also specified. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 1 | The list is given a name, but it is not specified what is stored there. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The list is obviously providing a purpose in the code block, which explains why it is necessary for the program to function properly. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The procedure’s purpose is stated, and it specifies that it is used to compare the user’s inputted letters to a random word. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The explanation of the technique is very detailed, explaining each step so that it can be repeated. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The output is tagged with the calls so that it may be easily located and compared. | . Reflection 2 . Between the grade I gave the project and the grade College Board assigned it, there was only one difference. I believed the list wasn’t being stored properly because it originated in the data abstraction section. Collegeboard thought it was being saved properly. . Submission 3 Grading Student Scoring CB Grading Additional Comments . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The show’s goal is to inform viewers about a specific American state. This provides a sufficient amount of context for the program’s goal, which is why it merits points. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The list’s name is provided, but it is absent and its purpose is not disclosed. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | Based on the justification provided in the written response, the lists’ relationship to the programs’ objective isn’t stated and is quite unclear. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Without the list, the program would be extremely inefficient and challenging, as mentioned in the clear statement that the program’s demise, but the code segment containing the procedure is not included in the written response. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The algorithm is incredibly inefficient because it checks each state individually by hand, which is why it doesn’t receive points for this part. | . Testing | 1 | 0 | The calls have a clear definition of the required output. All of the calls are included along with any potential influences. | . Reflection 3 . The only difference between my results and those of Collegeboard is the testing. Although Collegeboard thinks the Testing doesn’t meet the requirements to earn points, I granted the Testing section the points because it contained all the calls required to do so. .

Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | How the data is saved and what kinds of data are displayed in the list of “fishtype” | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Without the list, numerous variables would be required to store a lot of data, making the code challenging to understand. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The near movement technique satisfies the requirements for getting points because it plays a significant role in the functionality of the code. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Because of the thorough explanation, anyone can accurately duplicate the algorithm and follow its steps. | . Testing | 0 | 0 | The calls are well specified, however the documentation makes no mention of potential program errors. | . Reflection 4 . My score matches the college board’s score identically. Due to its simplicity, this contribution was simple to understand how it operated and simple to score. Because I can now accurately score the full project, which I have definitely improved upon, my overall rating is improving. . Overall Reflection . I think my score is on par with those obtained by these instances on the CollegeBoard. I have a basic understanding of the specifications and what my project needs to succeed. To satisfy everyone’s needs, my project must be broad and have a variety of features and abstractions. One of the most obvious reasons a contribution would not have passed the standards in one area was a lack of a thorough explanation of how something functions. I’ll keep that in mind and make sure to include as much information as I can to show how my project meets the criteria. .",

Reflection . There was one discrepancy between my grading and CollegeBoard’s. I gave the student the point for program purpose and function because they stated that it “provided infomration on a triangle based on inputted side lengths”. I believe that this, along with their additional commentary, did satisfy the requirements for the overall purpose of the program. In order to ensure that I satisfy this requirement, I will throughly explain the purpose of my program and all of its features. I will use technical terminology to clearly convey my knowledge of the topic. A submission may fail to meet this criteria because they fail to discuss the functionality and output of their program appropriately.

Reflection . I agreed with CollegeBoard’s rubric grade for the 2nd performance task submission. The student clearly meets all criteria required for a 6/6 and had the necessary code and explanations to achieve this score. In my own work, I will ensure that I create mutliple procedures with parameters to manipulate lists. Lists are a large part of the CollegeBoard APCSP requirements, so I’ll add lots of data abstraction methods using them. There is no partial credit awarded, so I will make sure to follow every single requirement exactly. The student who created this CPT did just that. .",

Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | At first, I thought the student earned the point because they were able to articulate the function, the purpose, and the input and output. Following an examination of the college board scores, I found that the student had not complied with the requirements for explanation since their explanations of the function and purpose appeared to be inconsistent, and their input and output were incorrect. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The information in animalList is not explained in the response. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The student illustrates how the complexity and lack of a list will change the code. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The user includes a parameter, but they are unable to describe how the operation works in general. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The user offers a brief overview but doesn’t clarify how the algorithm can be duplicated. Sequencing, selection, and iteration are among the information offered. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | Inputs of various types are provided, and the submission describes the results that follow, explaining any differences. | . Submission 2 Grading | Student Scoring | CB Grading | Additional Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The program’s goal, to “discover creativity,” is explained by the student, who also explains how it works. As a result of user input, they also describe how the outcome will change. all requirements are met. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | A list is named and its purpose and usefulness are described by the student (nounList). | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | In response, it is explained in detail how complexity is handled and how the software would be altered. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response identifies the createPoems process and describes how it enhances the overall functioning. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Response provides full reasoning for selection, sequencing, and iteration. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | Response outlines the circumstances and demonstrates how various inputs lead to various results. | . Submission 3 Grading | Student Scoring | CB Grading | Additional Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | Fails to thoroughly explain the function | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Defines and explains a list (findCharacterList). Describes the operation and goal. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Regulates complexity. The solution explains how the character can be kept in a single variable rather than seven, making the code more effective and compact. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Describes how the function is used and how it works. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The response demonstrates how the algorithm could be reproduced and explains iteration, sequencing, and selection. Additionally, two parameters have been established. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | This response describes two separate situations and provides examples to show how different inputs lead to different outputs. satisfies all demands. | . Submission 4 Grading | Student Scoring | CB Grading | Additional Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | Response satisfies all requirements and includes input and output justifications, a goal (to test critical thinking), and an overall function. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The student has named a list (guesses) and described its items, but she has not explained the list’s general function or goal. The Collegeboard claims that because this response simply indicates that the list’s data is not being used and that just its length is accessed, its purpose is not made clear and hence it does not meet their criteria. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The response is unsatisfactory because it doesn’t discuss alternative ways the code could have been constructed. The list, according to Collegeboard, is merely being utilized as a counter and could be swapped out for a single counter variable. This would imply that the learner is not entirely aware of the code’s concept or how it may be improved. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The answer is well-informed since it describes how the function operates and how it adds to the program’s overall functioning. Additionally, the student created a procedure (isitcorrect) using a parameter. This demonstrates that the student has a solid grasp of the code and its functionality within the application. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Because the response offers justifications for iteration, sequencing, and selection, I agree with the Collegeboard’s conclusion that it is a good response. | . Testing | 1 | 0 | Instead than responding to two different parameters that result in different code execution, the response described the criteria being tested. CB added that the procedure call’s arguments should have particular values. | . Make sure to fulfill every condition since if you just fulfill 5 of the 6 requirements, you will receive a 0. I should evaluate my code and be as explicit as I can in my written response to ensure this. A majority of the marks are awarded for the ability to describe the intent and functioning of one’s code, thus avoid writing much or too little. .",

Lesson 17 and 18 . Notes: . Algorithm efficiency is the ability of an algorithm to solve a problem in an efficient way | A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer | There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: Decidable Problems Undecidable Problems | A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. | The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). | It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. | Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks 1 D9 . One situation in which a computer might run into an undecidable problem is when it is asked to determine whether a given program will halt or run indefinitely. This problem, known as the Halting Problem, is considered undecidable because there is no algorithm that can consistently determine whether a given program will halt or run indefinitely for all possible inputs.The Halting Problem is a classic example of an undecidable problem because it demonstrates the inherent limitations of computation. In order to determine whether a program will halt, a computer would need to be able to analyze the program and its input, and then make a prediction about its future behavior. However, because programs can be arbitrarily complex and can exhibit unpredictable behavior, it is impossible for a computer to accurately predict whether a given program will halt or run indefinitely. To illustrate this point, consider a program that takes an input and then checks whether that input is a valid proof of the Halting Problem itself. If the input is a valid proof, then the program will halt; if the input is not a valid proof, then the program will run indefinitely. Because there is no way to determine whether a given input is a valid proof of the Halting Problem, it is impossible for a computer to accurately predict whether this program will halt or run indefinitely for all possible inputs. .

Unit 3 Section 8.1 - Taiyo Iwazaki . Lesson Objectives: . Express an algorithm that uses iteration without using a programming language | Define an iteration | The Basics Of Iteration | Examples | LESSON Vocab: . Iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | Before we dive deeper, we need to understand that an iteration is a part of an algorithm. And in that iteration is a set of instructions that need to be followed until a certain desired output is met. . Examples . Here is an example using online shopping: . . Lets say you are looking for a lost item inside of your house... What steps would you take? . Suppose there are n rooms to search... number the rooms 1-n . | Start by searching in room number 1 . | Search each room thoroughly for you item. . | Change the room number to the next highest number . | Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have found your lost item. . | Enjoy the lost item. . | WAIT! There is a flaw in the program. . This is where a stopping condition is useful for when the iteration already meets the desired requirement and gets out of the loop. . Programming Examples . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): #Try changing the 5 and see what happens! print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 if (i == 3): #Try Changing the 3 and see what happens! break . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . These are just a few examples of what you can do with iteration. . Summary: . An Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | We can use stopping conditions to stop an iteration if a condition is already met | . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 - Parav Salaniwal . Lesson Objectives . Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements | Learn how to use iterations with for loops and while loops | Creating code to learn how to incrementally list numbers | Learn the range function and using variables in code | . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . The first function we will learn is the range function, which we will use with for loop. As you may be able to guess, this will give us the sum based on the input provided. We always use a variable, such as i, to represent what the range of numbers the output will show. For example, if I wanted to list the numbers from 1-10 using the range function, it would look like this: . for i in range(11): print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Now the first thing you may notice is my input for the range was 11, and you may wonder why is it not 10? This is because when using the range function, the last number, or the ending value, is not included in the output, therefore we would have to add 1 to receive the correct output. Now if we were looking to include a starting value to have it start from 1 and end at 10, the code would look like this: . for i in range(1,11): print(i) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . When using the range with for loop, the you can list much more than just a increment of one, would anyone like to guess how we could include a change in the incremented value? Try making a change in the python code above to change the incremented value. When using the range function: . for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value): print(i) . Now with while loops, we can provide a similar output with a variation in the input. Similar to for loops, it requires a variable which is the starting value. . i=1 while i&lt;=10: print(i) i=i+1 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Based on your knowledge from for loops, which values in the code above are the starting, incrementing, and ending values? . LESSON . . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 - Nikhil . Here is some basic code I have created, let&#39;s first look into this one: I created a list of pets, cat, dog, fish, and snake. Then I created a for loop, &quot;for i in pets&quot; and this looks at every element/value in pets, so &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;snake&quot;. This next if statmenets checks if the element in the list is &quot;fish&quot; and if it is, it breaks the loop. The statement would just print, cat and dog since the loop breaks at fish. . pets = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;] for i in pets: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) . cat dog . This while loop checks if number less than 10 is even and if so, it will print out the even numbers. We set a starting value of number = 0, then while the number is less than 10, the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. So let&#39;s check for 0, while 0 is less than ten, then it moves to next statement, since 0 divded by 2 has a remainder of 0 it will print the value of 0. Now it will add 1 to zero. Then it will see that 1 is less than ten, and then check if 1 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 which it does not, so it skips the print, and goes straight to addding one, so on so forth. . number = 0 while number &lt; 10: if number % 2 == 0: print(number) number += 1 . 0 2 4 6 8 . The purpose of this code is to find the sum of all the even numbers between and any number of your choosing. The integer input asks for the minimum and maximum value. The next statement puts a starting sum value set to 0. The for i in range (minimum,maximum+1) looks at every number between those two values, in this case 1 and 100. Then the if i modulus 2 checks if any numbers that are divisible by 2 and the remainder comes to 0. If there is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, it adds that number to the sum. Then the last print statement, prints out the final sum of all even numbers between the two numbers of your choosing. . minimum = int(input(&quot;please enter a minimum number you want your range to be&quot;)) maximum = int(input(&quot;please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value&quot;)) sum = 0 for i in range(minimum,maximum+1): if i % 2 == 0: sum += i print(&quot;The sum of all the even numbers between&quot;, minimum, &quot;and&quot;, maximum, &quot;:&quot;, sum) . The sum of all the even numbers between 1 and 3 : 2 . LESSON . . HACKS Unit 3 Section 8 . Hacks Unit 3 Section 3.8.1 .

            "content": "Night at the Museum . During the night of the museum event, I was able to see the projects of my classmates and students from other periods, even though my time at the museum event that night was only for 30 minutes. Due to the fact that our project was not entirely finished, my group received a lot of comments and tips from other students. We drew more influence from other projects to alter the project’s looks and add new features, like a comment section where users could discuss the various teams we offered. One parent in particular asked us questions regarding the site’s mechanics and general programming, which we were able to satisfactorily respond to. They also suggested that we change the site’s colors to match the theme of basketball more. I really enjoyed getting to know people from different classes and interacting with those who weren’t involved in CSP and are thinking about joining. . CollegeBoard APCSP Multiple Choice Final . As we had to take the APCSP CollegeBoard final, I felt confident knowing I have truly learned a lot from this class and taking advantage of my resources. I have been working with my team and using external resources such as the CollegeBoard videos. Creating multiple pages from fastpages templates throughout the year helped me understand how to code with ease for both the front end and back end. I had completed the CollegeBoard MC Final and received a 45/50. . The 5 questions I got incorrect are below: . . A1. The correct answer to this question above was option A: I and II only. This is correct because the usernames of the people on Brandon and Cynthia’s contact lists are irrelevant to which restaurant to eat yet, although knowing the geographical location is relevant because it is looking to find restaurants near by. . . A2. The correct answer to this is option D: Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices. This is because protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way. . . A3. The correct answer to this is option C. This is because protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way. This is because if the number of units of electricity used is 25 or less, the cost is 5 times the number of units. Otherwise, the cost is 5 times the first 25 units plus 7 times the number of units above 25. . . A4. The correct answer to this is option A and D. This is because for option A, the code segment sets maxPS to 50 by default, then uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time &gt; 120. . . A5. The correct answer to this is option C. This is because the first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of y (which is 50) to x. The fifth statement assigns the value of z (which is 75) to y. The sixth statement assigns the value of x (which is 50) to z. Therefore, x and z both have the value 50. .",

            "content": "List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern Dictionary is used to define data patterns. Iteration is often used to process through lists. To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Position:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Position&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;NFL Draft Pick:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;NFL Draft Pick&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;NFL Top 100 Rank:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;NFL Top 100 Rank&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Total Yards:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Total Yards&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Total TDs:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Total TDs&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Teams: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Teams&quot;])) print() def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output Deebo Samuel Position: Wide Reciever NFL Draft Pick: Second Round Pick 36 NFL Top 100 Rank: 19 Total Yards: 1770 Total TDs: 14 Teams: San Francisco 49ers Matthew Stafford Position: Quarterback NFL Draft Pick: First Round Pick 1 NFL Top 100 Rank: 27 Total Yards: 4886 Total TDs: 41 Teams: Detroit Lions, Los Angeles Rams .",

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env .
