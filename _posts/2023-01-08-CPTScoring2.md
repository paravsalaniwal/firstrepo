| **Submission 1 Grading** | Student Scoring | CB Grading | Additional Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | At first, I thought the student earned the point because they were able to articulate the function, the purpose, and the input and output. Following an examination of the college board scores, I found that the student had not complied with the requirements for explanation since their explanations of the function and purpose appeared to be inconsistent, and their input and output were incorrect.|
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The information in animalList is not explained in the response. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The student illustrates how the complexity and lack of a list will change the code. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The user includes a parameter, but they are unable to describe how the operation works in general. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The user offers a brief overview but doesn't clarify how the algorithm can be duplicated. Sequencing, selection, and iteration are among the information offered. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Inputs of various types are provided, and the submission describes the results that follow, explaining any differences. |

| **Submission 2 Grading** | Student Scoring | CB Grading | Additional Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The program's goal, to "discover creativity," is explained by the student, who also explains how it works. As a result of user input, they also describe how the outcome will change. all requirements are met. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | A list is named and its purpose and usefulness are described by the student (nounList). |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | In response, it is explained in detail how complexity is handled and how the software would be altered. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response identifies the createPoems process and describes how it enhances the overall functioning. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Response provides full reasoning for selection, sequencing, and iteration. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Response outlines the circumstances and demonstrates how various inputs lead to various results. |

| **Submission 3 Grading** | Student Scoring | CB Grading | Additional Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | Fails to thoroughly explain the function |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Defines and explains a list (findCharacterList). Describes the operation and goal. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Regulates complexity. The solution explains how the character can be kept in a single variable rather than seven, making the code more effective and compact. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Describes how the function is used and how it works. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The response demonstrates how the algorithm could be reproduced and explains iteration, sequencing, and selection. Additionally, two parameters have been established. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | This response describes two separate situations and provides examples to show how different inputs lead to different outputs. satisfies all demands. |
