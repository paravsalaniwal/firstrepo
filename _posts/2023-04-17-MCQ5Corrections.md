The code segment assigns the initial value of ```first``` to ```temp```, then assigns the initial value of ```second``` to ```first```. The initial value of ```first```, which has been stored in ```temp```, is then assigned to ```second```. Therefore, the initial values of ```first``` and ```second``` have been interchanged.

The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the
