I came into this course with little to no background knowledge on coding and overall learned so much more and I am very proud and happy with Mr. Mortensen and Mr. Yeung to help teach me to become a proficient coder today. Throughout the year, I learned implementing 4 key languages (Python, HTML, Javascript, and CSS) and learned how to use different types of repositories such as Fastpages, Flask, and the Leuck Reunion template. It was difficult during the first trimester to understand where I was and how all this code ties in together, but I slowly and surely found my way. With persistence, I was able to delve deeper with these talents, and I became stronger with the more experience that I was gaining. Knowing Python algorithms and data structures was one of the most important skills I acquired this year. I also greatly improved my application of other skills, like collaboration and communication, through regular meetings with the scrum team, code reviews with Mr. Mortensen and Mr. Yeung, and student-taught lessons, which allowed me to succeed not only in the classroom but also with other important parts of education during application. I am excited to continue my education and learning in AP CSA and throughout my career.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">N@TM Blog Tri 3</title><link href="https://paravsalaniwal.github.io/firstrepo/2023/06/06/N@TM_Tri3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="N@TM Blog Tri 3" /><published>2023-06-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-06-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://paravsalaniwal.github.io/firstrepo/2023/06/06/N@TM_Tri3</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overall Experience: I believe this trimester was a great success and way to end my sophomore year for Computer Science. I felt like I accomplished and learned so much throughout the entire year starting from the basics of python and fastpages to creating my own online games. N@TM was a great way to show all the progress I had made and to cap it off as we presented our live tracking NBA stats analyzer, which gets all the stats of each player on each team and uses data tables, bar graphs, and pie graphs to help analyze the data and role that each player has on the team. I believe this N@TM was a good way to continue and end off the year‚Äôs solid projects, as last trimester my group had a really well developed game page. I think we impressed lots of people this trimester as we had a larger gathering around our project including students, parents, and even Mr. Mortensen. They all seemed very happy and proud of the project we had set up, because we were able to thoroughly explain the code behind the frontend and backend of it, and the functionality as well as how complex it was to even have data like this output.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Python 2D Iteration and Animation</title><link href="https://paravsalaniwal.github.io/firstrepo/1.d/2.b/3.b/c3.1/2023/05/16/DS-arrays_lab.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Python 2D Iteration and Animation" /><published>2023-05-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-05-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://paravsalaniwal.github.io/firstrepo/1.d/2.b/3.b/c3.1/2023/05/16/DS-arrays_lab</id><author><name></name></author><category term="1.D" /><category term="2.B" /><category term="3.B" /><category term="C3.1" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several 2D arrays and Animations hacks are provided to further learn iteration and data in Python.
